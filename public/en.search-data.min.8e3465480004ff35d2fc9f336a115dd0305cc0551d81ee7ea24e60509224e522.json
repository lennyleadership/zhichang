If it\u0026rsquo;s a shot in the dark, take a moment to see where in the framework it fits the best, if you can. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, just use your best judgment. The next two questions will help you with that.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste your time fighting petty battles. When you do that, then people will see you as someone who is a bully. If you want to clear a room, or at least take all the sunshine out of it when you approach, be sure to fight over the little things.\nIt takes wisdom and experience to know when to fight and when to lay down your weapons. Sure, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll be angry. Just don\u0026rsquo;t let it flare so much that it takes over your thinking. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve answered this question, ask yourself this one:\n“Will doing this someone else\u0026rsquo;s way be wrong?” # It takes a strong leader to admit that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be right all the time.\nIt also means you\u0026rsquo;re smart enough to know that you\u0026rsquo;re not perfect.\nAll anyone can do is the best of which they\u0026rsquo;re capable.\nWith that in mind, can you use someone else\u0026rsquo;s idea to get to your desired outcome? Of course, you can.\nA wise person once said, “Ideas don\u0026rsquo;t care who has them.” Everyone\u0026rsquo;s brain is creative, whether or not she thinks it is. We all have ideas. Some are good. Others, not so good. When you have a group discussion, you\u0026rsquo;ll have all sorts of ideas on the table. Usually, at least one of you will have the foresight to pick out the best idea from the lot.\nSo, don\u0026rsquo;t rely on the limits of your own experience while you\u0026rsquo;re working out a plan.\nBut as a leader, ultimately the final decision is yours. You can weigh that decision with the third question, which is …\n“Will taking this risk be worth it?” # You can\u0026rsquo;t escape risk. Nothing in life it totally safe and predictable. You can\u0026rsquo;t know how everything will turn out.\nSo, take a moment to think through the consequences of your choice. What do you know? What do you need to learn? What is the worst that could happen if you go ahead?\nAnswer those questions and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the answer to this question.\nAnd at the very least, when you do fight, at least you can do it in a civil manner. You can listen. You can debate. And you\u0026rsquo;ll have a foundation to guide you through the whole process.\nReference:\nMcKinley, Frank.

Any creative writing technique can be used to improve any kind of writing.\nShall I show you?\nCreative writing examples in non-fiction\nWhen reading non-fiction, I often find myself speeding up. I try to grasp ideas quickly, and I do not pay much attention to words and sentences.\nThe ideas feel worthy of my time, the writing not.\nI’m currently read Fathoms by Rebecca Giggs. It’s a book about whales, and the relationship humans have with whales. It’s half science, half philosophy. You may think that’s a recipe for boring writing.\nBut no …\nI find myself slowing down, paying attention, savoring the words like a good wine. This is especially true for the first chapter.\nWhat makes Giggs’ writing so enjoyable?\nShe knows how to captivate her readers; she knows how to choose words; and she’s added a large dollop of creativity to her writing.\nLet me show you …\n1. Zoom in\nIn her first chapter of Fathoms, Giggs describes how whales remain part of the ecosystem after they die.\nBut she starts by zooming into the story of one specific whale—a beached humpback whale:\nI put one hand briefly on the skin of the humpback and felt its distant heartbeat, an electrical throbbing like a refrigerated truck, sealed tight. I wanted to tap on the outside of the animal and whisper to it: Are you in there, whale? Neighbour, is that you? Life on that scale — mammalian life on that scale — so unfamiliar and familiar in turns. Oh, the alien whale. The world-bound whale. A stranger inside. I hated to watch it.\nNon-fiction writing is often abstract. We want to explain trends or general tips. But such writing is hard to grasp and easy to forget.\nSo, the trick to writing engaging non-fiction is to zoom into specific stories that illustrate your points.\nFor instance, when writing a blog post with tips, share a story—real or imagined—of someone who implemented those tips. On a sales page, a testimonial can take the shape of a miniature story demonstrating how a product or service has changed one person’s life.\nStories belong everywhere, in fiction and non-fiction.\nMore detailed guidance + more examples:\nHow to weave stories into your writing: The Zoom-In-Zoom-Out technique \u0026raquo;\n2. Paint vivid imagery\nGiggs paints vivid imagery, making me feel like I’m looking over her shoulder:\nThe whale was black like piano wood, and, because it was still young, it was pink in the joints under its fins. Waves burst behind it, sending spray over its back. Every few minutes, the whale slammed its flukes against the wet sand and exhaled loudly — a tantrum or leverage. Its soft chest turned slack, concertinaed by the pull of the swell.\nCan you picture the beached whale and hear it exhaling?\nVivid writing makes readers feel like they’re present in the story. Readers look through the author’s eyes, seeing what the author sees. They listen with the author’s ears, hearing what the author hears.\nReaders experience stories and that’s what makes stories memorable.\nIn non-fiction writing, you have several opportunities for painting vivid imagery. First, on a sales page, let readers imagine what it’s like to use your product or to work with you. How will you improve their lives? How will that make them feel?\nSecondly, make testimonials more like real life. Ask clients to describe in more detail what it was like to work with you. What specifically did they enjoy? And how has your service changed their lives?\nLastly, tell your own stories. For instance, on an about page or in a blog post, explain why you do what you do. What drives you? What makes your heart sing?\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: Use the 8 life forces to let readers imagine a better life \u0026raquo; How to write powerful testimonials: Templates + examples \u0026raquo; How to write an inspirational business story \u0026raquo;\n3. Hook readers\nStraight from the first sentence in Fathoms, Giggs hooks her readers.\nHere’s how her book starts:\nA few years ago, I helped push a beached humpback whale back out into the sea, only to witness it return and expire under its own weight on the shoreline.\nThat sentence makes me want to learn more. Why did the humpback whale return? How did it expire under its own weight?!!???\nI read on to the second sentence, which is even more intriguing:\nFor the three days that it died, the whale was a public attraction.\nSo much drama is in that one sentence. How could it take the whale 3 days to die? And how could that be a public attraction? There’s so much tension in the contrast between dying and being an attraction.\nYou may think your task as a writer is to explain, to educate, to inspire, or to sell. But if you don’t hook your readers first, you won’t get an opportunity to share your ideas or to communicate your sales pitch.\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: How to hook your readers \u0026raquo;\n4. Show and tell\nThe official advice in creative writing is to “ show, don’t tell.”\nBut in practice, we often show AND tell.\nTelling means giving a brief, factual statement. Showing means using sensory details and describing actions to direct a mental movie in your reader’s mind.\nFor instance, here’s how Giggs tells us how oceans were feared in the past:\nPeople once feared there was a terrible, existential emptiness in the ocean, an unpeopled and unending openness.\nIt’s an example of telling because we can’t visualize it. It’s simply a statement of people’s existential fear of the emptiness in the ocean.\nHere’s how Giggs finds a way to show this is true:\nIn antiquity, cartographers populated the seaward frontiers of their maps with drolleries. Hand-drawn pictograms, drolleries are whales hybridised with sea serpents; monsters adorned with antlers and tusks, scales and sprigs of feathers.\nShowing requires a writer’s ingenuity to find an example that can demonstrate that a statement is true. It not only increases credibility, but also makes the writing more interesting.\nSo, each time you make a generic or abstract statement, ask yourself: How can I demonstrate this is true? Can I share an example or two?\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: 18 show don’t tell examples \u0026raquo;\n5. Play with your words\nThe usual writing advice is to use the words everyone else is using, right?\nYes, plain language helps make your writing easy to read.\nBut your writing doesn’t need to sound like everyone else. You can add a little flourish here or there to let your personality shine through.\nFor instance, Giggs uses sensory language to help us imagine what it’s like to hear a whale breathe:\nStood ankle-deep on the beach at night, you hear them. That is, you hear the whales breathing. How the sound carries across the water, I do not know. A whale sneezes: you jump. It sounds like a roller-door slamming.\nAnd note the strong verbs Giggs uses to describe the sociable noises that humpback whales make:\nThe whales grunt, rasp, thwop, and moan; they shriek, whine, bubble, gurgle, and fin-slap on the sea’s topside, as well as generating what are called ‘pulse trains’: subsonic resonances, only recently discovered, that thump across the lower thresholds of human hearing like rain drubbing a tarp.\nThe words you choose help create your writing voice so readers can recognize your writing and look forward to hearing from you again.\nSo, when you’ve finished a blog post or a sales page, look for two or three important sentences, and then play with the words.

And there is plenty to be found in the sport of rowing.\nSome lessons are familiar, like teamwork. In rowing, you can\u0026rsquo;t move an eight-person shell if you don\u0026rsquo;t do it together. Then there\u0026rsquo;s adaptability, where, just as in business, no two days or even hours on the water are alike. Wind, water, equipment, and competition can never be fully predicted, so being able to adapt at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice is vital. But there\u0026rsquo;s another lesson that gives an edge in business as it does in rowing: free speed.\nTrue free speed in rowing would be having a lighter boat, which requires less energy to move, freeing up energy to gain speed - a real advantage. In contrast, false free speed is the rowers\u0026rsquo; joke about everyone in the boat needing a haircut, as if the loss of a few grams of hair could provide a similar competitive advantage. The difference seems clear, but it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable how hard-working rowers, just like busy entrepreneurs, allow the lines between true advantage and wishful thinking to blur.\nHere are three ways to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re gaining the advantage of free speed in your business\u0026ndash;and not just fooling yourself.\nShare your knowledge, don\u0026rsquo;t hoard it\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a fact: the more you know, the better equipped you are to achieve, adapt, innovate, and excel in business. If that\u0026rsquo;s what you want, you can\u0026rsquo;t hoard knowledge. Yet many entrepreneurs do. The rationale they hawk is one of control. In truth, hoarding knowledge is wishful thinking. Rather than speeding you up, inevitably it slows you and your team down. And think about it\u0026ndash;if you can\u0026rsquo;t trust your team with the knowledge they need to contribute to your collective success, then far bigger problems are looming on your horizon. Shared knowledge is power, and it\u0026rsquo;s the power you need to speed up the entrepreneurial success you seek.\nCreate a shared purpose, and practice it daily\nWhile powerful, knowledge is at best misguided speed if those you share it with aren\u0026rsquo;t all rowing in the same direction with a shared sense of purpose. Believing you can state the mission and just move on is effectively the business equivalent of choosing to row in circles, never actually achieving the bigger goals of ongoing success and growth. In contrast, having a shared sense of why you do what you do and linking it to your decisions and actions every single day builds the habit of advantage. The key here is applying shared purpose as a daily filter\u0026ndash;something few entrepreneurial teams do, and the main reason why they never tap the power of shared purpose. By working shared purpose into every thought and action in your business, it become a fine-tuning tool that helps you gain advantage. Doing so is simple, cumulatively powerful, and, best of all, free.\nEmpower your team to lead The greatest example of entrepreneurs mistaking wishful thinking for free speed is their reticence to allow leadership to be shared. Not sharing leadership is the equivalent of sharing knowledge and purpose, and then telling those you share it with not to act. Talk about weighing a business down.\nAt the end of the day - and every day - entrepreneurial success is a team sport. And you can achieve that success faster, and more often, when everyone is empowered to grab an oar and contribute.\nMy Leadership Lesson Take-away # exactly same motion, good timing.\nCoaching.

Rowing Terms # Seating: Seating positions in a racing shell are generally numbered from the bow to the stern in English-speaking countries, unlike many non-English-speaking countries which count from the Stroke forward. Generally the forwardmost rower is called the \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo; and the aftmost rower the \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;, regardless of the number of rowers in the boat, with all other seats simply being numbered. So for instance the crew of an eight (with coxswain) would number off from the bow: \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Two\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Three\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Four\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Five\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Six\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Seven\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;, whereas a four (with or without coxswain) or a quad would number off: \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Two\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Three\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;.\nBow (bow seat, person in charge): the rower closest to the front.\nStroke (Seat): The rower closest to the stern of the boat, responsible for the stroke rate and rhythm.\nStarboard (US): the right or starboard side of the boat\nPort (US): the left side of the boat.\nStern: The rear section of a shell.\nCommands # \u0026ldquo;Easy\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;ease up\u0026rdquo;)(USA): To stop rowing hard.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold Water\u0026rdquo;(USA): Emergency stop, also used after the command way enough. It instructs the rowers to square their blades in the water to stop the boat.\n\u0026ldquo;Let it/her run\u0026rdquo;: To stop rowing after a given piece of on the water rowing length, but to put the handles of the oars either to the gunwales or out in front of the rower, in such a manner that the oar paddles are parallel to the water yet not touching it. This allows the boat to glide for a distance leaving no paddle wake in the water. Similar, but not exactly the same is the command \u0026ldquo;Gunnel\u0026rdquo;, where rowers push the oars until the handle touches the boat\u0026rsquo;s gunwale.\n\u0026ldquo;Power 10\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;10 firm\u0026rdquo; ): The command to take 10 strokes at more than full pressure.

(sometimes \u0026ldquo;Power 5\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Power 20\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Power 30\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Hard on port/starboard\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;port/starboard pressure\u0026rdquo;): The rowers on that side of the boat must row harder (and the opposite side must row slightly easier) in order to facilitate a sharper turn.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/About_me/","title":"About Me","section":"Docs","content":" Strength # Feel confident talking in front of a group.\nA good listener.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t work for pay cheque.\nI always go beyond what is expected from my role.\nI am committed.\nI proactively start new initiatives.\nWillingness to share\nThings to Work on # To get buy-in from stakeholders.\nTo effectively influence others.\nTo deal with resistance.\nNeutral # I tend to strive for perfection.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/Soft-Skills/Leadership/Leadership_quote_in_Beowulf/","title":"Beowulf: Real Leadership is Leader Recognizing that They Serve the People They Lead","section":"Leadership","content":" Beowulf: Real Leadership is Leader Recognizing that They Serve the People They Lead # Real Leadership is Leader Recognizing that They Serve the People They Lead.\nby Pete Hoekstra\nThis quote perfectly describes the character of Beowulf. Beowulf is agood leader because he shows bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people in spite of the dangers hefaces throughout the poem. In the story, Beowulf knew that his people needed a leader and that hewas the only one who could save them.\nLeadership in Beowulf\nTo be labeled a good leader, a person must exhibit bravery. At the beginning of the poem, Beowulf and fourteen of his men sailed to Denmark to rid the kingdom of an evil monster named Grendel, a descendant from Cain. Beowulf had heard many stories about how Grendel killed all of King Hrothgars men. Beowulf travels to Denmark because he wants to fight Grendel to test his bravery and to save the kingdom. He knew that he would be the only one in the land with enough courage to battle the enemy. After killing Grendel in the mead hall, Beowulf was honored by hundreds ofpeople in the kingdom for being their brave hero. Beowulf was able to be victorious over Grendel because he did not let his fear of failure stop him from saving the lives of many people (Leadership in Literature)\nAnother quality of a good leader is someone who is honorable. An honorable person is someone who is noble, trustworthy, and ethical. Before leaving for his fight with Grendel, Beowulf throws away his sword and armor so the fight would be fair, since Grendel has no idea of the arts of war, or shield or sword play (681-682).\nBeowulf states that he would find no satisfaction in beating Grendel unless the fight was completely fair, which meant he would have to fight the monster bare-handed. Beowulf shows his true character in this scene of the poem because only the most honorable of men would risk his life so that no person had the greater advantage over the other. Grendel, on the other hand, shows his moral inferiority once he attacks Beowulf and his men in their sleep. Beowulfs honorable heart is rewarded at the end of this battle by being able to defeat his unworthy foe (Brave New World).\nLoyalty is one of the most paramount qualities of a great leader. A good leader must be trustworthy, leaving his/her people without a hint of doubt that they will not be let down. After the tragic death of the young King Heardred, the kingdom was in dire need of a new leader. This was when Beowulf steps in. Not only does Beowulf rule the Geats, but he did so for over fifty years. During his time as king, Beowulf fought in two more treacherous battles, allied with the Danes, and brought the kingdom significant amount of riches. Beowulf was a devoted leader to his people and showed his loyalty to them by his courageous heart and wise mind. The Danes not only praised Beowulf for being a fearless warrior but also for being the loyal ruler they needed so gravely for their kingdoms sake (Brave New World).\nA leader is someone who serves the people they lead. Beowulf recognized the desperate need for a leader and he knew he was the only one suited for the task at hand. Beowulf makes a good leader because he exhibits great amounts of bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people. Beowulf selflessly risked his life multiple times for the sake of the Geats. Beowulfs exceptional leadership qualities of bravery, honor, and loyalty will be remembered by readers for years and years to come.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/Soft-Skills/Lead-Unleadable/Set_boundaries/","title":"Empower People and Avoid Conflict by Setting Boundaries / Expectations","section":"Lead Unleadable","content":"Analog: Keep dog fenced in.

That\u0026rsquo;s the way people see you.\nThree ways you can handle conflict: prevention, discovery, and hitting it head on.\nAn Ounce of Prevention # As a leader, you\u0026rsquo;re a lot like a fireman.\nOne aspect of a fireman\u0026rsquo;s job is fire prevention.\nYou \u0026lt;prevent fires by keeping gasoline away from lit matches.\nRules and vision statements provide an excellent way to prevent conflicts. They do this by writing scripts that people use to define their activities. If the script is good, there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any misunderstanding that can lead to a fight.\nWe wear masks of civility around others rather than speak everything that is in our minds. For example, if you thought your coworker\u0026rsquo;s dress was absolutely ghastly, would you tell her if it really didn\u0026rsquo;t matter in the grand scheme of things?\nOf course, there is a time when honesty is called for. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be brutally delivered if a softer hit will do the job. The measuring rod for this is what effect something has on the group as a whole, not just you.\nSo, make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t put flammable materials together if you want to prevent conflicts.\nDiscovery - A Prescription for Peace # There\u0026rsquo;s always something hiding in the bushes that can catch fire.\nDo your best to discover what they are so you can address them before they turn into full-scale conflicts.\nPeople forget the organizational mission, too. Most of us forget every thought about work when the five o\u0026rsquo;clock whistle blows. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;ve asked anyone, \u0026ldquo;Are you ready for the weekend?\u0026rdquo; the answer is always some form of \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; After that, we have to psyche ourselves up for another workday. As a leader, it\u0026rsquo;s your job to periodically, even daily, remind your team what game they\u0026rsquo;re playing - and why.\nHitting Conflict Head On # So don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Be strong and courageous. Fight if you must, but do all you can to keep the bleeding to a minimum.\nAlso, remember why you\u0026rsquo;re fighting. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a vision to guide you, you may not have the resolve to see it through. And you might make a choice that will make the conflict worse.\nReference:\nMcKinley, Frank.

If you\u0026rsquo;re nervous, your voice will reveal even the slightest quiver and hesitation. And if you\u0026rsquo;re disinterested, it will take away from the melody you normally have when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling great.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the solution?\nActing classes?\nNo.\nShould you just fire the person due to irreconcilable differences?\nThat might be admissible in court if you\u0026rsquo;re getting a divorce, but not in the workplace.\nThe Power of Forgetting\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s really good to forget.\nThe best thing you can do when you have to work with someone who annoys the snot out of you is to forget that you can\u0026rsquo;t stand them.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll bet you\u0026rsquo;re standing there thinking, “Yeah, like I can do that.”\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t, then you\u0026rsquo;re dead in the water.\nThree Reasons Why You Should Forget You Can\u0026rsquo;t Stand That Annoying Coworker Here are some things to remember when dealing with someone who makes your life difficult.\n1. As people, they have value.\nIf you believe life is precious, you have to agree that people—all people—have value.\nNow what about vicious criminals whose sole purpose in life is to maim and kill? Don\u0026rsquo;t they deserve to die?\nSure.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s think about this. When someone\u0026rsquo;s behavior is reprehensible to the point of killing others, death is a reasonable punishment. But you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that in our court system, that is the last resort. Why? Because we as a society value life. We want to believe in second chances. We want to give others every opportunity to make things right.\nAnd, if you were to be convicted of a murder you didn\u0026rsquo;t commit, would you want to be quickly condemned to death?\nSure, she may have some annoying habits like filing her nails during meetings. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s loud enough to hear across the building when she talks. But if she has a brain, she has the potential for good ideas. If she has friends, then she must be doing something right.\nAnd if she was hired, someone (maybe even you) thought she could do the job. So, give her respect as a fellow human being.\n2. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s opinion matters.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t always agree with other members of your team.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not always right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to have debate on issues. For example, you can benefit from others\u0026rsquo; experience even when you both do the same thing. If she\u0026rsquo;s had more success, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like to know how she does it?\nEveryone has ideas. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not all the same, it\u0026rsquo;s good to use each other to get better. If you like basketball, will you be your best if you only practice shooting hoops by yourself?\nNo, you need competition to prove how good you can be.\nLet your coworkers make you sharper.\nThen do the same for them.\n3. Remember that when you don\u0026rsquo;t like a suggestion someone makes, she may be right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to let your opinion of someone color your perception of how good her ideas can be.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like someone, you\u0026rsquo;re probably predisposed to think of her suggestions as worthless.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nForget what you think about anyone. Listen with open ears. You might learn something. You might improve.\nWho knows, that suggestion might open the door to new opportunities that never existed before!\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t be able to take that action if you decide to be petty.\nNow Move Ahead\nPart of being an adult and a leader is being honest with yourself.\nYou may not like everyone. And it\u0026rsquo;s true you won\u0026rsquo;t like everyone the same no matter how hard you try. It\u0026rsquo;s okay. Commit to respecting others—no matter what—and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get things done.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;ll be the leader you dreamed you could be.\nAnd who knows? You might just turn an enemy into a friend.\nReference McKinley, Frank. How to Lead Unwilling Followers: Strategies to Overcome Resistance (Leadership Series Book 2) . Sagacity Learning Solutions.

It really comes down to people. and who are the people that you\u0026rsquo;re supporting for admission? and you want those people who love the sport deeply. It\u0026rsquo;s not work. they love it, they enjoy it and they have the capacity to work with other people. I mean the another word that I\u0026rsquo;d use in this relationship which seems how would you call it almost flip. it\u0026rsquo;s got to be fun. and if you now if you look at the energy and that Yale boathouse the over these past five or six years it\u0026rsquo;s wonderful. today is a perfect example of that that way or that element that culture you know we had five recruits on campus, we interviewed them. or at the end of that 48 hour process we bring them to the armor room and Davenport and we ask them if they have any questions and thoughts and how the weekend was. and to the man. They said they were just really drawn to the spirit of the group. They said during practice the energy how they bond after practice and it\u0026rsquo;s just they\u0026rsquo;re working their butts off and at the same time there\u0026rsquo;s a lightness to it and a good energy to it how do you bring it about? attract people of that nature and that\u0026rsquo;s what we did. you don\u0026rsquo;t change. when people talk about a change of culture. it\u0026rsquo;s rare.in my experience. that that culture has changed without a significant change in in the people.\nJim Millar: Steve, Leadership is critical. it\u0026rsquo;s critical on a rowing team. You\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in many different universities where I\u0026rsquo;m sure the selection for captain each year has been different. Any thought you have on the the best selection process? and which has resulted in the best captain selections on a consistent basis?\nSteve Gladstone: At most of the places that I\u0026rsquo;ve coached, the captain has played a very very very small role. Yale, it\u0026rsquo;s very different and I think that\u0026rsquo;s just a tradition that exists at Yale throughout all their athletic programs. In fact, that subject came up in our first head coaches meeting three days ago. Yes it Yale. it\u0026rsquo;s an important piece. and a good captain, you know, can certainly, how would you call it, expedite or enhance a good culture. That\u0026rsquo;s for sure and I must say, the last, this is sort of a personal level in the last couple of years, at three years at Yale, it\u0026rsquo;s been extraordinary with Rob Earned, Paul Jaco, and Sholto Carnegie. yeh absolutely exceptional. but basically it\u0026rsquo;s the energy of the group. its individual energy and very often the energy is coming from people that are not, yeh not necessary the captain.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/Soft-Skills/Lead-Unleadable/Transform_conflicts/","title":"Transform Conflicts into Opportunity","section":"Lead Unleadable","content":"If you want to lead through resistance, you must see every conflict as an opportunity.\nConflict is Inevitable\nThe story of Joseph illustrates two great truths.\nConflict is part of life, like it or not.\nNo matter how well you plan out your life, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t turn out exactly as you planned.\nWe engage in conflict for three main reasons: # The first is enforcement of a rule, policy, or standard.\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s important enough, it\u0026rsquo;s worth fighting for, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? So what is the yardstick that determines whether or not something is important?\nYour organization\u0026rsquo;s mission statement.\nUnless you have one, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to really know what\u0026rsquo;s important. When you fight for something that\u0026rsquo;s important only to you, you come off as a dictator. But when it\u0026rsquo;s a well-known standard, you stand a better chance at being seen as a fighter for the good of everyone.\nThe second reason we fight is to set a new standard.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always the chance that someone will come along and push a boundary that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been pushed before. Your mission statement is a more general guide when this happens. As a leader, your maturity and good judgment will be your best weapon in this fight.\nAnd when you\u0026rsquo;re done, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the precedent to set a new standard.\nThe third reason we fight is to grow.\nWhen we grow from children into adults, we experience pain and bouts of awkwardness. Young people who are adult-sized don\u0026rsquo;t have the experience to match their appearance. Lessons can come from a classroom, which isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed to be pain-free. Or they can come from experience, which often has no mercy for the uneducated. Either way, you can choose to learn and be better next time. Or you can sink into bitterness and learn nothing, leaving yourself to experience the same pain again.\nNew ideas and procedures will meet resistance. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already decided it\u0026rsquo;s important enough, brace yourself to do the tough things required to make it the new normal. But also be prepared to extend the grace that is required for a new way to be universally accepted.\nCommunicate Clearly # Conflict often comes with verbal challenges.\nHow can you be sure you don\u0026rsquo;t make the conflict personal and abusive?\nFirst, make use of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; statements.\nThis is a page out of every assertiveness training manual in print. For example, rather than say, \u0026ldquo;You make me angry\u0026rdquo;, you would say, \u0026ldquo;I feel angry about this.\u0026rdquo; Or you could say, \u0026ldquo;I feel angry about the way you handled this.\u0026rdquo; So, instead of placing the blame for your feelings on her, you take ownership of your feelings.\nThen you\u0026rsquo;ll have a chance to talk freely.\nSecond, don\u0026rsquo;t characterize someone\u0026rsquo;s arguments.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to read into something someone says. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume you know what she\u0026rsquo;s thinking. Repeat what you heard and ask her if it sounds like what she meant.\nThe temptation when you\u0026rsquo;re angry is to do the opposite. You might want to call her a babbling idiot. You might wish she\u0026rsquo;d just die of a sudden heart attack. But remember, she\u0026rsquo;s as human as you are. So give her a shot at making a difference for good.\nThird, listen intently.\nThe biggest temptation when an argument is flaming like a fiery furnace is to insert your own agenda with no consideration whatsoever for the other person\u0026rsquo;s opinion.\nIt takes a ton of patience and self-control to do the opposite.\nIf you want an argument or discussion to move forward, everyone must have his say. Otherwise, you might as well just make all the decisions yourself and just enforce them on everyone else.\nBut then you\u0026rsquo;d be dictating instead of leading.\nLeaders are listeners. They listen because they are learners. And since you can only learn so much from yourself, you need other people to make you sharper.\nSo let others have their say – and listen intently.\nWhen It\u0026rsquo;s All Over # Fires don\u0026rsquo;t burn forever. If you leave them unattended, they die out. If you pour fuel on them, they stay alive.\nWhen you have a conflict, do your best to keep it short.\nWhen it\u0026rsquo;s over, you need to clean up quickly.\nThere are two reasons for this.\nFirst, you clean up quickly to maintain the relationship you had with the other person. Sure, the conflict probably ruffled a few feathers. But apply the outside of the sandwich approach. Help her to see after that bad experience that you are there for her, you\u0026rsquo;ll give her the help she needs, and that you too will be having the same growing pains.\nSecond, you need to follow through on any promises you made. Do this quickly or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose the momentum you got all bloody to put into motion.\nAnd if you keep your word, everyone will know you are serious.\nNow Do This # Margaret Heffernan, bestselling author and businesswoman said, \u0026ldquo;For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate.\u0026rdquo;\nReference: McKinley, Frank.

Can you persuade readers to contact you? And buy from you? Can you make your content easy to read, engaging, and inspirational?\nGood writing isn’t as hard as it seems.\nLet’s start at the beginning, shall we?\nWhat makes a sentence good? # Picture yourself home alone. It’s Friday night.\nYou treat yourself to a glass of red Rioja Reserva, and you sit down in your favorite sofa to read the book you received from a friend. At last.\nYour phone rings. But you let it ring. The neighbor’s dogs are barking, but for once you don’t hear them.\nWhen you’re so engrossed in your book, you read complicated sentences with ease.\nA sentence of 63 words? You gobble it up:\nIf you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. ~ J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye\nNow imagine yourself at your desk, starting to read the first out of more than one hundred unread emails in your inbox. How much time do you allocate to each email?\nYou might read a short email word by word. But when it’s long? You glance. You skim.

The biggest problem in business writing is generic gobbledygook. To avoid wishy-washiness, add specific facts to your sentences.\nFocus on your reader. Good marketing copy doesn’t feel like a sleazy sales pitch. It’s a cozy conversation with your reader.\nMake your readers feel something. Scrap weak words. Instead, add emotion or paint a picture. Make your content more dramatic with action sentences.\nKeep your average sentence length at a maximum of 14 words. A lower average would be better. The examples below have on average 9 words per sentence, making them easy to read.\nBe concise. Eliminate each redundant word.\nConciseness isn’t about the length of a sentence. A long sentence can be concise when each word is relevant and adds meaning.\nFinding these 5 keys a little vague and abstract?\nLet’s analyze a few examples …\n5 examples of good sentences in business writing # Example 1: a stylus for iPad # Our adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page. Rest your hand on the screen, write from any angle. No calibration or setup. You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.\n4 sentences. 36 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\nThis paragraph is clearly focused on the reader, listing various benefits of adaptive palm rejection.\nThe benefits are ranked using the So what? method:\nThe adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page. So what? You can rest your hand on the screen and write from any angle. So what? You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.\nThe benefits show a superb mix of problems you avoid—no mistaking your hand for your stylus, no calibration, no setup—and positive benefits—write from any angle, forget you’re creating on a tablet.\nExample 2: iPad Air # Not just a thinner display. A better display.\nThe displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal reﬂectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid.\n61 words. 7 sentences.\nWhy these sentences are good:\nThe two opening lines, and the question The result? might all be crossed out by your high school teacher because they’re broken. But these broken sentences add a dynamic rhythm to Apple’s writing. Read the paragraph aloud and you’ll hear what I mean. Apple copywriters are the masters of broken sentences. The technical explanation is specific—three simple sentences explain why iPad Air 2 is thinner (because it fuses three layers into one), and why this means the display is better, too (no gaps so no internal reflectance). After the technical explanation, the closing line returns back to the reader by explaining what it means for the reader to have a better display. This sentence harnesses the power of three—highlighting three benefits in a row (colors, contrast, and images). Example 3: A curry (ready-made meal) # You’re in Vietnam. You’ve whizzed around Hanoi in a rickshaw. You’ve walked around admiring the rice fields and the meandering waterways of the Mekong Delta. You’ve smiled and nodded enthusiastically at some happy locals. And right now you’re settling down for a delicious, flavoursome meal of udon noodles, veg, tasty sauce and spices. Enjoy (chopsticks optional).\n6 sentences. 56 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\nThe first sentence is sublimely short, making it easy for your reader to start reading the next sentence. The text paints a clear picture by using vivid imagery—rickshaw, meandering waterways, Mekong delta. The text is action-focused, adding drama—you’ve whizzed, you’ve walked, you’ve smiled and nodded. Do you find yourself smiling, when your read this, too? This vivid description elevates eating curry to an exotic experience full of joy. Example 4: Gifts for guys # We say ‘no’ to ugly neckties, cologne samplers and executive trinkets. We don’t save wrapping paper, we don’t do ribbons.\nWe ship bragworthy gifts for guys.\n3 sentences. 26 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\nHow specific can you get? Man Crates doesn’t tell us they dislike boring gifts for men. They tell us specifically what type of gifts they don’t like. Pretty clear, isn’t it? The sentence We ship bragworthy gifts for guys is more persuasive after the explanation of what they don’t do. Man Crates speaks strongly to their target audience. Note, for instance, the word bragworthy—according to some dictionaries it’s not even a word. Example 5: Web hosting # Is your website up? More importantly, are search engines and subscribers receiving your content? If you are a content publisher, you need to know. But unless you are actually on the site, how do you know?\n4 sentences. 36 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\nWant to speak strongly to your reader? Then enter the conversation already going on in your reader’s mind. That’s exactly what these questions do. Did you find yourself quietly nodding yes, while reading these questions? When you start nodding yes, you’re more likely to say yes to their offer of web hosting, too. This is what psychologists call the consistency principle. Once we’re in the mood for saying yes, we keep saying yes. In my free snackable course I explain this power of the subtle nod. Good writing starts with an appreciation of sentences # I like this anecdote that Annie Dillard shares in her book The Writing Life:\nA well-known writer got collared by a university student who asked, “Do you think I could be a writer?”\n“Well,” the writer said, “I don’t know…. Do you like sentences?”\nThe writer could see the student’s amazement. Sentences? Do I like sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, “I liked the smell of the paint.”\nThe truth about writing a good sentence # Writing for business isn’t like academic writing.\nDon’t show off your intelligence. Don’t brag about your command of words originating from Greek and Latin. Don’t impress your readers with undulating sentences.\nYour content isn’t about you and your business.\nYour content is about your readers.\nConnect with his wishes, dreams, and secret desires.\nBe engaging. Be enchanting. Be good.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/Soft-Skills/Communication/Indian_communication/","title":"明白潜在的需要","section":"Communication","content":"为什么美国公司的印度裔CEO那么多，只是中国人传说中的“印度人爱抱团”那么简单吗？\n1/5、客户和老板的要求为什么老是不清楚\n还记得17年刷爆朋友圈的这幅漫画吧\n以前广告圈里的同事转得最多，说多了都是泪啊，十个客户九个不知道自己想要什么，有时候连客户自己都会说漏嘴：\n“我要是知道，还找你们做什么啊？“\n和甲方有得一拼的是“老板的要求”，总有人在后台留言：“老板一会儿要我东，一会儿要我西，不知道他到底想要什么”，套用这个句式：\n“如果老板知道要做什么，还要下属干什么？“\n这句话听上去好像是在调侃“老板”和“甲方”什么都不懂，直到有一天，一个比较“谦虚”的甲方对我说：\n“我们确实不知道应该做些什么，但我们确实知道必须做些什么，所以我们才来找你们，你们专业嘛。”这话我至今记得。\n用专业的话来说——需求不明确。\n客户今天说最近产品销售疲软，想找你们做个推广——可这根本不是需求，导致销售不好的原因实在是太多了。\n老板让你整理一下主要配件的供应商，开会要讨论——也这不是需求，整理的目的到底是什么？\n也许是太忙了，也许是专业能力所限，他们并不知道具体要你做什么，但只要你的东西一出来，他们立刻就知道：这不是我要的东西。\n事实上。专业人士有两种，一种人有了明确的需求才能工作；而另一种人更擅长利用自己的专业能力，挖掘对方潜在的真实需求，帮助他们找到问题所在。\n很多时候，我们是在借抱怨客户和老板，来掩饰我们不擅长“通过专业沟通挖掘他们的真正需求”。\n前段时间，我看了中兴通讯印度分公司前总裁汪涛的一篇分析“为什么美国大企业中的印裔国际CEO的数量那么多”的文章，文中有一段就比较了中印两国员工的“专业沟通能力”。\n2/5、中国员工和印度员工在沟通上的差别\n如果有客户找中国工程师做东西，对话通常是这样的：\n客户：“我们这次大概想要一个这样的东西，……（此处略于50字），目前想法还不成熟，你们还有什么问题吗？”\n中国员工：OK，没问题。\n而内心独白却是这样的：你啥都不知道，我问个屁啊。我想就这么这么做，做出来再跟你们谈吧。\n于是，这群最优秀的中国员工就开始用自己天才的大脑，想象客户遇到的问题，他们立图让自己的方案变得非常华丽，非常前沿，非常牛逼，等着客户说“哇，太棒了，就这么搞。”\n结果可想而知，客户看傻眼了，NoNoNo，这不是我想要的，全部重来。\n工作清零，好在此时中国员工有点明白客户需求了。可他们真的都明白了吗？\n那么印度员工是怎么做的呢？\n客户：““我们这次大概想要一个这样的东西，……（此处略于50字），目前想法还不成熟，你们还有什么问题吗？”\n印度员工：“好的，我们回头列一些问题，再跟你们进行第二轮沟通。 ”\n回到公司，他们不慌不忙地开始讨论，既不加班，也不占用午餐时间，过了两天，列出了整整24个小问题。\n**和客户的第二轮沟通，他们会用一天的时间，把这24个问题一个一个地讨论完。**如果冒出了一批新问题，就再进行新一轮会面，直到把所有问题全部沟通得一清二楚，他们才开始……干活？\nNoNoNo，他们还要把所有沟通结果整理成一个文档，再跟客户开一次会，把自己的理解再跟客户确认一遍，去纠正双方在理解上的分歧。\n最后，他们还会把这些沟通结果整理成详细的文档，发给客户，再抄送所有项目组的成员，确保大家的理解都是一致的，才开始正式干活。\n这两种工作方式的结果就是：中国员工做出来的东西有想法，有新意，但不到最后关头，你根本不知道自己会得到什么； 印度员工的工作平庸，刚刚好用，一点也不肯浪费自己的工作，但却刚好是你想要的。\n如果你是老板，你喜欢用那一种员工？\n3/5、崇尚实干少说的中国文化\n轮聪明，印度人绝对比不过中国人。编程挑战网站HackerRank分析了递交的140万份编程挑战代码，结果显示中国程序员的得分最高，统治了数学、函数编程和数据结构领域，远远超过人数更多的印度程序员。\n但印裔国际CEO的数量之多，也是不争的事实。美国的500强企业的75位少数族裔CEO中，10位是印度裔；谷歌董事会的13人中，4位是印度裔；高科技公司里7%的CEO也都来自印度，而且比例还在升高。\n很多管理学家认为，印度人的成功，很大程度上来自于他们严谨的沟通能力。\n但在有海外工作经验的中国员工印象中，印度裔CEO普遍能说会道，拍马屁不干实事。\n一个事实，两种观点，这其实是一个“沟通文化”的差异。\n中国人去了印度，总觉得印度人都是奇葩，毫无时间效率的概念；印度人接触了中国人后都认为，中国人太过变态，做什么事情都是急吼吼地先干起来再说。\n中国的时间观念强，所以觉得沟通太浪费时间；印度人自我感觉太好，不愿意白费功夫，宁可把话先说清楚。\n事实上。在中国的文化传统中，我们不喜欢那些能说会道的人，更崇尚实干精神，所谓“满瓶不动半瓶摇”。\n中国历史上的聪明人，都不喜欢沟通，反而爱故弄玄虚。诸葛亮有了作战计划，从来不跟大家解释，每回都要摆一桌酒席，反正大家都没心思吃，全到他一个人的肚子里了。\n诸葛亮式的老板，计划的所有细节都在他一个人的脑子里，做他的下属，需求都是明确有，只需要听命令，甲干啥，乙干啥，最后大家的工作一拼，刚好完成任务。\n不习惯沟通，造成了两个问题，一部分人“表达能力弱”，无法把对客户的理解表达成准确的语言，只能先“做出来”再说。\n而另一部分“沟通达人”走上另一个极端，他们平常说的“沟通一下”，更多是强调诱导、说服，甚至是诡辩，而不是理解对方的想法。\n教育也是一个原因。我们的学校教育总是以标准答案为核心，很少让学生们针对问题，去提出自己问题，长此以往就不会提问题了。一旦面对不确定的需求，往往无所适从。\n中国社会的商业信任度低也是一个原因。因为乙方常常用专业来欺骗甲方，甲方在和乙方的沟通中，总是半信半疑，相信眼见为实，喜欢让乙方多做几次给自己挑选的余地。\n不得不说，也许是中国人既聪明又勤快，聪明到觉得别人无法理解自己，勤快到觉得沟通是一种浪费时间，宁愿浪费自己的才华，多返几次工，也不愿多费口舌。\n因为彪悍的人生不需要解释啊。\n4/5、机会太多，懒得沟通\n很多人可能不服气，你说印度人管理能力强，为什么印度本土厉害的大企业没有中国多呢？\n因为沟通只是管理的一部分，管理还包括战略和执行效率，不同的市场阶段，管理的重点是不同的。\n在一个高速发展的蓝海市场，执行效率最重要，如果一定要把需求搞得一清二楚再动手，等别人先做出来了，那你就白干了。因此只要需求大致靠谱，大可以撸起袖子先干起来。\n大的互联网企业甚至连内部都在竞争。同一个项目，往往有不同的小组在做，之间没有任何沟通。对于企业而言，宁可浪费财力物力人力，也不可浪费时间，市场太大了，只要有一个组做成功，别的组的投入总能收回来。\n但在一个成熟的市场，处处是红海，人力成本高昂，市场变化慢，时间反而不值钱，就要精细化管理，充分沟通需求，否则，“高效率”带来的必是高浪费。\n所以印度人的“沟通能力”，在本土市场就是浪费时间，但到了美国，面对高素质的西方员工和成熟的市场，就会如鱼得水。\n另一方面，中国制造的强项是标准化产品，可以通过产品的不断升级，一步步改善客户体验；但广告公司服务客户，下属服务老板，显然都属于定制化的专业服务，需要大量的前期沟通，最后才能一锤定音。\n在一个成熟的、规范的、缺乏弹性的竞争环境中，那些搞不清客户需求的“先干起来”，显然既浪费了自己的精力，又浪费了对方的时间。\n那么，我们应该如何挖掘客户或老板潜在的需求呢？\n5/5、需求沟通的三个阶段\n需求沟通通常包括三个阶段：激发潜在需求、明确核心需求、形成行动框架。\n在汽车没有诞生之前，你问客户想要什么，他一会回答，想要一辆更快的马车。\n所谓“潜在的需求”，不是客户说“我要XXX”，而是那些让他们夜不能寐的恐惧、如鲠在喉的痛苦、甚至是那些“嘴上说不要，身体却很诚实”的内心渴望。\n这就是**“激发潜在需求”的阶段**，它只能通过貌似效率低下的交流来实现，这同时也是给对方一个明显的信号：在搞清楚你到底想要什么之前，我是绝对不会动手的。\n在**“明确核心需求”阶段**，重要的是确保双方对文字的理解都是一致的。中文是一种多义的语言，这个阶段必须消除每一个可能产生歧义的句子。\n乙方和员工们在沟通中，常常故意留下一些模糊地带，以方便自己的执行，这就是甲方和老板们深恶痛绝的**“专业陷阱”**，殊不知这点小聪明会让你失去信任。还不如开诚布公地请客户和老板理解，执行过程中必要的弹性空间。\n最后是**“形成行动框架”阶段**，这个阶段最重要的是保证每一个参与的成员都能明白，而不仅仅是负责沟通的人。\n一开始，有些人可能觉得你太“唐僧”。别在意，只要你最终能证明自己是一个靠谱的人，人家总会尊重你的工作习惯的。\n广告圈有一句名言：“最好的提案，不是现场把客户给震了，而是走走过场。“\n不让你让玩猫腻，而是说要在前期沟通中，帮助对方找到真实需求，商量出双方都能接受方案，这么一来，老板和客户们还有个屁意见啊？\nReference\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/example/table-of-contents/without-toc/","title":"Without ToC","section":"Table of Contents","content":" At me ipso nepotibus nunc celebratior genus # Tanto oblite # Lorem markdownum pectora novis patenti igne sua opus aurae feras materiaque illic demersit imago et aristas questaque posset.

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme.

We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this.

There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage # The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.

We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type.

Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring.

Communication skills are, therefore regarded as an essential skill by employers. When you’re going for a job interview, you can be sure that the interviewer will ask you about your communication skills. Communication job interview questions are asked in almost every interview, regardless of the position you’re applying for.\nThe interviewer wants to test and evaluate your communication skills and find out how you handle challenging work situations. Your answers give the interviewer the information needed to assess whether or not you’re the right candidate for the job.\nIn this article, interview questions about your communication skills are discussed. Furthermore, information is provided on how you should approach and answer these questions. Also, read more about frequently asked job interview questions here and check our job interview preparation checklist.\n1 Communication Job Interview Questions \u0026amp; Answers\nWhy the interviewer is asking about your communication skills # In a work environment, a lot of processes rely heavily on sharing information. Therefore, strong communication skills are essential in order to deliver and understand information accurately and quickly. Poor communication skills can negatively impact business processes and could cause misunderstanding, frustration, and even failure. This is one of the factors why interviewers want to assess your skills. In general, questions about your communication skills are asked to measure your ability to communicate in different situations and with different personalities. The ability to communicate efficiently is needed not only for being productive in your work but also for creating a healthy work environment.\nEmployees, no matter their position in the company or seniority level, interact with colleagues, team leaders, managers, clients, customers, or partners daily. This is why good communication skills are important in the workplace. For instance, a senior manager should have the ability to communicate tough decisions and possess the ability to handle difficult situations and discussions at work. Customer service representatives need to come across as genuine, friendly, and empathetic when talking to unsatisfied customers.\nA job interview allows employers to assess and evaluate how the candidates communicate and handle situations. The questions they asked can also focus on teamwork to see how you collaborate on teams and whether or not you are able to efficiently convey and listen to messages.\nOne way to get answers is by using behavioral job interview questions. These types of strategic interview questions require you to provide the interviewer with an example situation that you experienced in your career. Behavioral job interview questions focus on work situations that you experienced in the past and how you responded to them. The way you respond to these questions tells the interviewer more about your work methods and ethics.\nBehavioral job interview questions # Certain job interview questions that the interviewer asks you to assess your communication skills are called ‘ behavioral job interview questions.’ These questions focus on professional work situations that you experienced in the past. The way you respond to questions about handling situations tells the interviewer more about how you convey your message.\nThere are several reasons why interviewers use behavioral interview questions. The objective of a hiring manager is, of course, to hire the best candidate for the job. They want to avoid hiring the person that they ‘like’ best and need something better to assess whether or not a candidate is a right fit for the job. By asking you questions that let them analyze your professional behavior in the workplace, the interviewer can test your suitability for the position.\nBehavioral job interview questions usually start with:\nGive me an example of Tell me about a time when you Have you ever What do you do when Describe situations where These interview questions are often used to assess certain skills such as communication, but also about your level of adaptability, teamwork, or leadership skills. The interviewer will focus his questions on important characteristics that you need to possess to be regarded as suitable for the position. Your past behavior in professional work settings will be discussed. The reason for asking behavioral job interview questions instead of just asking traditional ones is that the most accurate predictor of future performance is your past performance in similar situations.\nInterviewers consider the following when using behavioral questions in a job interview:\nBad hires are costly Hiring the wrong candidate is one of the most expensive mistakes a company can make. A bad hire can have an impact on the rest of the team and even worse, their clients/customers. The costs of turnovers are high, not only in terms of money but also in terms of time. Therefore, interviewers ask you different kind of questions to assess your suitability.\nSpecific details of your professional behavior Behavioral interview questions are used by interviewers to determine how your past performance aligns with their current hiring needs. The answer you give provides the interviewer with more insight into your behavior in the workplace, your problem-solving skills, and personal attributes.\nPast behavior in the workplace is a good predictor for future performance Interviewers ask you about how you handled situations in the past because for them this is a good indicator of your future success. This proven technique can give more insight into your future work performance. Therefore, prepare well for these questions and expect questions about communication such as ‘ describe a challenging work situation and how you overcame it?‘, ‘ Have you ever had difficulty working with a manager?‘ ‘ What’s your approach to delegating work to others?‘, or ‘ Tell me about a time you managed an important project?‘. All these questions require you to highlight how you communicated in that particular situation. Based on your answers, the interviewer wants to assess whether or not you’re a fit for the job and company.\nThe interviewer can avoid making the wrong decision The ultimate goal of using behavioral interview questions is to make the right hiring decision. Interviewers are interested in your previous patterns in work-related situations. This information gives them more insight into your approach to critical situations and if this approach matches the ones required for the position you’re applying for. By preparing the right way, you can make sure that your example answer situations include aspects of the important job requirements. Of course, the interviewer is looking for candidates that fit the job description, so make sure to make your answers related.\nWhy your communication skills matter to the interviewer # As said earlier, communication skills are vital in the workplace. The interviewer wants to know how you approach certain situations. It’s therefore important that you are able to demonstrate the needed skills for the job in your answers. The example situations you use should demonstrate that you can take on the day-to-day tasks required for the position and have development potential.\nBehavioral interview questions are used to find out who you really are and how you go about handling certain situations. The interviewers want to get the following questions answered:\nAre you easy to get along with? Can you communicate effectively with different personalities? Are you able to adequately respond to situations that occur during your work? Are you able to adjust to changing work environments? Can you assist your coworkers or team when needed? Are you flexible in your approaches to situations at work? Top communication skills that interviewers are looking for # There are several communication skills that interviewers can be looking for during a job interview. Most of these are general in nature and applicable to most work situations that you can encounter in your workplace. If you really want to stand out from the competition, you need to do your research the right way by figuring out what exact communication skills the employer values. Once you know this, you can play into the situation by highlighting your communication skills in example scenario’s on how you handled similar situations in the past. Remember, strong communication skills will really help you get hired, get promoted, and will help you progress further throughout your career.\nListening # Communication starts with listening effectively. It’s important to take your time to actually listen to what the other person is trying to say practice your active listening skills. Nobody likes to communicate with a person who only cares about conveying their own story and does not take time to listen to someone else. Some who has the right listening skills listens with his/her whole body, is alert and is genuinely interested in another person. A good listener does not interrupt someone else mid-conversation and reflects back on what you heard the other person saying.\nNon-verbal communication # Communication is much more than just words and the message that they convey. It includes implicit messages through non-verbal behavior. Non-verbal behavior includes your facial expressions, eye contact, the pitch, and tone of your voice, and gestures that you make through your body language such as hand, arm, and leg postures. Some research estimates suggest that around seventy to eighty percent of all communication is non-verbal.\nEnsure that you use your non-verbal communication to reinforce what you’re saying in words during a job interview.\nEmpathy # Demonstrating empathy means that you are able to understand and share the feelings of somebody else. Of course, in a professional work environment, everybody will have their own ideas on how things should be done. However, even though you might have disagreements with your colleagues or superiors, you should always consider and respect their point of view.\nFriendliness # The right tone is important in any kind of communication. The actual way you say things impacts the way your message is received. A friendly tone leads to others being encouraged to communicate with you. Being polite will get you a long way in all your workplace interaction, whether it’s face-to-face or written communication.\nCohesion, clarity, and concision # When you communicate with other people, make sure that you’re clear, concise, and articulate. Good communication is not only about saying the right thing, but also about communicating your message to-the-point and efficiently. A lack of clarity in a message can result in confusion or even a poor decision.\nEmotional intelligence # Your emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of others as well. This ability is important for employers because if you have a high EI, you’re more likely to express your emotions healthily in the workplace. Also, you’re more likely to understand the emotions of your coworkers and clients. In turn, this can enhance working relationships in the workplace and impact performance in a positive way.\nWays of showing emotional intelligence are, for instance, through active listening. You can also demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing the right emotions to establish a connection with the interviewer. Think of smiling (as long as it does not appear inauthentic or forced) and showing enthusiasm and excitement for the position. Other ways of demonstrating emotional intelligence is:\nBy sharing the credit for team achievements Demonstrating how you are trying to improve yourself as a professional Showing that you can learn from your mistakes through examples Not shying away from discussing conflict situations at work Confidence # Showing confidence when you’re conveying your message is crucial. However, showing confidence does not mean over-confident or cocky. Demonstrating to the interviewer that you can, for instance, interact with customers with confidence will have a positive effect on your chances. Provide them with examples that show that you can convince customers in such a way that they get faith in your abilities to deliver whatever it is they need.\nShowing confidence in a job interview can be done in several ways. First off, make sure that you practice keeping good eye contact while you’re listening, but also when you’re speaking yourself. When it comes to your body position you want to maintain a neutral and open position. Don’t cross your arms but keep them by your side. Furthermore, talk clearly and slowly during the interview. Other than that, smile! Come across as if you’re enjoying the process through calm facial expressions.\nThe final tip to show confidence in a job interview is by interviewing the interviewer. Besides that this shows that you’re well prepared it’s an opportunity to indicate that you’re not looking for any position, but that you’re looking for the right position.\nRespect # Respecting other people’s opinion and ideas is key for a good communicator. When you convey respect towards other people, they will be more open to communicating with you. You can show respect through various simple actions such as mentioning someone’s name, through eye contact during the conversation and actively listening when somebody is talking. Make sure the person you’re talking to feels appreciated and stay focused when talking to them.\nOpen-mindedness # Being flexible and open-minded in conversations are traits of strong communicators. Try to understand another person’s point of view and actively listen to the message that they are trying to convey. Even if you disagree, always remain calm and see if you can reach a middle ground that could benefit all parties involved. When you approach situations or discussions, open-minded a successful outcome is more likely to happen.\nTone of voice # The tone of voice that you use can influence and steer the whole conversation. You can imagine that if you start your conversation in a calm and constructive way, the person you’re talking to will be more inclined to respond similarly. The same way goes the other way around. If you start by going on the offensive, your conversation partner is more likely to do the same. Make sure that you control the level of emotion and the volume of your voice the right way.\nFrequently asked job interview questions about communication skills # Below you find a list of common interview questions about communication.\nTell me about your greatest accomplishment Describe a time you had a conflict and how you resolved it Where do you see yourself in five years? Imagine you’re having a disagreement with a superior. How would you resolve this? How would you go about explaining a complex situation or challenge to a client?

Preparing answers to job interview questions about communication # There are several important elements to take into consideration when you’re preparing for job interview questions about your communication skills. Include the following point in your interview preparation:\nDo your research # Thoroughly study the job description and company in general as the start of your interview preparation. This research will help you identify the needed competencies, skills, and abilities.\nWrite down a list of competencies, skills, and abilities # Behavioral interview questions are very good to actually demonstrate your talent, competencies, and results. Based on the competencies, skills, and abilities you have identified, you can prepare answers to behavioral questions. A lot of companies are looking for similar skills such as teamwork, leadership, flexibility, attention to detail, adaptability, creativity, responsibilities, etc. Rank the skills on importance in relation to the requirements of the job that you are interviewing for.\nCome up with a list of your past experiences that relate to the job you’re applying for # Next, make a list of past work experiences. Make sure to highlight successful situations where you demonstrated behavior related to the competencies, skills, and abilities required for the job. Focus on delivering a concise and to-the-point answer.\nFocus on successful situations and challenging ones # Just like you should be able to discuss a successful situation, you should also be prepared to answer questions about challenging situations. Make sure that you have some examples ready of situations in which you faced a challenge but came out successfully. Tell the interviewer what you did, why you did it, and what the outcome was. Also, explain what you learned from the situation. Focus on demonstrating problem-solving ability, adaptability, and ability to professionally approach situations. There’s always a chance that the interviewer will ask a follow-up question to test your self-awareness by asking how you might handle a similar kind of situation differently now.\nUse the STAR method to structure your answer # During your job interview, the interviewer wants to discuss previous work situations and wants you to elaborate on them. By preparing example scenarios, you can give exactly the information that he or she is looking for. Make sure that you provide the interviewer the situation you were in, your task in that situation, the action you took, and the specific results that can come out of those actions. In short, this is called the STAR-method of providing an answer. The STAR method is discussed in more detail later on in this article.\nThe STAR method allows you to concisely provide the interviewer an answer by logically walking them through the situation. Below the STAR method is discussed step by step.\nGeneral elements to consider when structuring your answer: # Give the interviewer an answer in the form of a ‘story’ and structure this story logically. Use the STAR interview technique to do this. STAR is an acronym that stands for a situation (S), your task (T) in that situation, the actions (A) you took, and what results (R) you got based on your actions. These are the basic steps you take in your walkthrough.\nDisplay the skills and abilities that are needed for the job you’re applying for and that the interviewer wants to see. Make sure you match your qualifications to the job and skills as mentioned in the job description.\nBe honest. Interviewers will notice if you make a story up. Also, they will ask follow-up questions to go more in-depth into the situation you provide them with. Make sure to prepare several example situations of skills and abilities that you think will be discussed based on your research.\nSTAR Interview Technique # Behavioral job interview questions are best answered by providing example situations according to the STAR method. This way, you can give interviewers exactly what they are looking for. Also, it allows you to provide a concise and to the point answer about how you acted in previous work situations. Below the STAR acronym is broken down into each step.\nSituation # When you give your answer to the interviewer, start by setting the stage. Provide context around the situation or challenge you were facing. Also, make sure to provide relevant details.\nTask # After you describe the situation, talk about your specific responsibilities and what your role was. It’s important that the interviewer gets an understanding of your task.\nAction # Then, talk about the actions you took to resolve the challenges you were facing. Provide the interviewer with a step by step description of what actions you took.\nResult # Finally, talk about the outcomes of your actions. Make sure to take credit for your behavior that led to the result. Here you answer questions such as What happened? What did you accomplish? Also, provide the interviewer with information about what you learned from the situation. Make sure to focus on positive results and positive learning experiences.\nSample answers to interview questions about communication # Below you will find some example interview questions about your communication skills. Some example answers are longer than others, and it’s up to you to figure out how concise your message should be during a job interview. In the examples below a lot of detail is included to convey your message the right way. However, these are ‘general’ examples. Do not forget to structure your own answers in a way that convinces the interviewer that you’re the right person for the job!\nCommunication interview question example 1: # The first questions regard a situation in which you had challenges working with a manager or other superior. It’s important to approach such situations in a diplomatic way in order to change the situation.\n‘Tell me about a time you had difficulties working with a manager. How did you address these challenges?’\n‘In my previous position, I worked with a team supervisor, where I initially had difficulties getting along with. With regard to my job performance, I got less feedback than I got from other managers in my career, which sometimes made it difficult to meet expectations. This made it challenging for me to evaluate my performance, as well. In the beginning, we had a few disagreements, but I found out that these were based on misunderstandings in communication.\nI requested a meeting with her and asked if she could provide me with more direct and specific feedback on work that needed to be done. She understood what I asked her and from that day on, we were on the same page in terms of expectation. We had a successful working relationship for over four years after that meeting and worked together on several large projects. What I learned from my previous experience is that I should take time to discuss management styles with new managers and make sure that expectations from both sides are clear. Clear communication is definitely the key to success.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\nThis is an honest answer about a situation that required you to use your communication skills. The answer includes how you communicated throughout the process and which actions you took to address the situation. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience. Communication interview question example 2: # This question regards a situation in which you had to manage an important project. As with everything in the workplace, clear communication is key. It’s your goal to demonstrate that you possess solid communication skills in order to get your message across and get the project done according to the set requirements.\n‘Tell me about a time you had to manage an important project. How did you approach this, and how did you communicate your strategy?’\n‘I’ve been involved in multiple important projects in my previous position as a sales manager. One time I was asked to set up a project team to work on a sales pitch to convince a new client to use our services. The pressure was on because it was a 5-year deal and a multi-million dollar contract that was at stake. For the company as well as for me personally, this was a big deal. As this deal would mean a lot for the company in terms of turnover increase, I understood that failure was not an option because it was a unique opportunity.\nI gathered a team of the most experienced employees and selected them based on their individual qualities and strengths to make sure to balance the team out. Together with the team, a planning document was set up, and goals and milestones were determined. After that, I delegated tasks based on the knowledge and experience levels of each team member. Also, I hired a project manager to carefully monitor the progress on a day to day basis and report to me on the milestone progress.\nBecause I distributed the responsibilities according to experience and knowledge levels, everyone on the team was aware of their responsibilities and the importance of the project. The team delivered everything on time without requiring intense oversight. We finished our sales pitch ahead of the deadline and were able to provide the client with everything he asked for. The client told us that he was impressed by our efforts, and we landed the contract, which was the largest contract closed in that year. This was a great accomplishment for the team as it was an effort that could not have been made without the people on it.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\nThis example shows that you are able to perform under pressure and communicate a strategy to a team. The provided example is related but also relevant to the workplace. It demonstrates that you are able to adapt to a situation. This answer shows important skills such as clear communication, proactive, problem-solving skills, teamwork, and creativity. Communication interview question example 3: # Demonstrating leadership is all about clear communication and making sure everybody is fully aware of their responsibilities. These questions are often asked in more senior positions but can also be asked in graduate-level job interviews. Interviewers ask this to gauge your leadership potential.\n‘Tell me about a time you had to demonstrate leadership.’\n‘In my previous position, where we ran behind on a new company-wide system upgrade that was going to fix issues we had with our online orders. The delay in implementation took longer than expected and caught us off guard. We had the holidays coming up, which counts for almost 25% of our annual revenue. My team had to work double shifts to process all orders, and the outlook was that this was needed until the system upgrade was placed. This led to people being stressed and overworked, which cause the team morale to drop. As the team manager, it was my responsibility to get the team performance back to normal.\nI gathered the team to discuss the situation. I expressed my appreciation for their effort during this challenging situation for the department and company in general. During our meeting, I called upon their assistance to find a way for the team to work more efficiently, including myself, for however long the system update was not implemented yet. I actively participated in the group’s brainstorming session and encouraged the team members to talk freely and discuss options. After an hour, we created a shortlist of options on which we voted. I created teams of two within the team to further investigate how we could implement the discussed options.\nThe result and learning moments\nThe reaction of the team to this approach was very positive. They appreciated being involved in such an important process to work on a solution that would benefit both the team and the company. By working together and focussing on a shared goal, the team worked in a productive and creative way to find a solution. Also, the fact that their ideas would be heard immediately helped to come up with several solutions that could be implemented right away. These solutions saved us valuable time and energy. One of the ideas was to bring in temporary workers that could be trained on the job by the current team members for as long as the update was not implemented. This ultimately led to us hitting our marks for the holiday season. We were able to reach the needed levels of revenue.\nListening to team members and quickly taking action to follow-up to their ideas really helped increase work efficiency and morale. Based on this positive experience, we decided to include such brainstorming and idea evaluations into our monthly meetings. This way, team members would stay more engaged, and we would get more knowledge of what actually goes own in the heads of the team members. Also, there’s now a plan in place with the HR department in case such a situation occurs again in the future to make sure we always have enough people to perform up to our potential.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\nThis answer shows that you are able to handle unexpected situations while still being able to strategize and lead a team. This shows that you take responsibility when it’s time to do so. The answer includes how you communicated throughout the process and which actions you took to address the situation. Also, the answer shows that you can handle and structure a team while still communicating clearly and involving everybody in the process. This is what leadership is all about. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience. Communication interview question example 4: # Certain situations in the professional workplace require some extra motivation. Motivating others is done through communication. This question requires you to explain how you motivate others and give an example of a time when you did.\n*‘Tell me about a time you had to motivate your team and how you did this.’\n‘When I worked at XYZ as a project manager, the company hit a rough patch which led to company-wide layoffs. My team consisted of ten team members, but after the layoffs, we remained with six, but we were still responsible for the duties of the four co-workers that left the company. As a result, we fell behind on production and team morale suffered as well. This, in turn, led to more errors on the work floor. As the project manager, I was ultimately responsible for team performance, so it was my duty to get the team back on track.\nI got together with the team to discuss the problems they encountered and to discuss strategies on how we could work our way through these issues. First and foremost, I complimented them on their effort and dedication during this complex time for everyone. After hearing their challenges, I asked them to give suggestions on how we could solve them and how we could increase our effectiveness and efficiency. We brainstormed for over an hour in which every team member had his or her say, and wrote down ideas that could benefit us. After a team vote, we prioritized the ideas, and each team member got assigned a task.\nThe team reacted positively after being included in the approach to solve the issues in this challenging time. They were able to present their own solutions and could immediately start research the feasibility. We came up with specific ideas that could be implemented fairly quickly and increase efficiency.\nThe result and learning moments\nFirst off, we asked our team assistants to clean up the agenda’s of everybody on the team so that only important meetings remained. Then, we asked the team assistants to pick up some tasks that were burdens for the other team members. This way, the team could analyze the additional work that needed to be done and share these tasks among each other. This made the team more efficient and effective. Also, it boosted the morale up again because even though it was a challenge and a lot of work, team members knew what they needed to do and what their responsibilities were.\nBy actively involving the team in important decisions about team strategy, we got better results. We decided to implement such brainstorm sessions into our monthly meetings.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\nThis is an honest answer about a difficult time in a company that required you to step up and motivate others. The answer described the situation clearly and what you did to motivate others in order to work your way through challenging times. The answer includes how you communicated with your team and how you included them in the process. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience.

A comprehensive method was developed for detecting quantitatively 32 compounds, including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene (BTEX). We ran proficiency test (PT) tests with this method.\nDuring our routine analysis, we ran samples for BTEX with a shortlisted method in which there were only BTEX to cut off the time to process data.\nTwo VOCs mixes were purchased. Styrene was added to a commercially available ATG-17, and the rest of the 32 compounds came from another mix called ATG-16. Even though we used the customized ATG-17 for the routine analysis, we did not report styrene.\nI used to purchase standard mixes by myself during the method development and validation.

What did you do to resolve the situation? Why did you select these actions? What was the final outcome? Looking back, what would you have done differently? Why? (Maximum 500 words.)\nI once had a co-worker in our section at AECL who procrastinated testing and put team members down to make them look better. As a result, samples that they were responsible for were analyzed beyond the requested holding time. They missed the client\u0026rsquo;s expectations. The team morale went down. Some internal clients chose to subcontract analysis for a better turn-around-time service.\nI have developed some strategies to resolve the situation with the manager, which can be categorized into improvement, mitigation, and control.\nSetting performance objectives with the SMART approach (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). It is an effective tool because they agreed upon those objectives at the beginning of the fiscal year. I observed that they were good at keeping their reputation in public. Therefore, my manager and I held them accountable in section meetings. They accomplished work very well, and we recognized their efforts in public. The person worked better under the senior technologist\u0026rsquo;s influence. Therefore, I leveraged the peer influence to push them to get started. Occasionally the senior technologist had to work with them side-by-side. They accomplished works well, but it is not sustainable. Once the senior technologist retired, their productivity suffered. I realized that they were good at administrative work. As a result, the manager and I reduced their analysis responsibilities to minimize the operation\u0026rsquo;s damage and assigned more administrative work. In addition, we asked them to join the site safety committee and other administrative-related work. I applied the idea of \u0026ldquo;the emotional bank account\u0026rdquo; from the book \u0026ldquo;The 7 habits of Highly Effective People\u0026rdquo; to them. We maintained a positive work relationship, even though I had to deal with conflicts with them. With the advice of the Employee Assistance Program at Morneau Shepell, I was able to identify the root cause of their behaviour. I shared it with the manager, but we did not come up with better solutions for this one. Looking back, I wish I could have been trained earlier in business psychology at AECL before handling the difficult employee situation. Here is an example: I later read a book, \u0026ldquo;The Platinum Rule,\u0026rdquo; later on. The principle is \u0026ldquo;Do unto others as they would like done unto them.\u0026rdquo; Then the author developed strategies to work with persons in four categories, Directors, Socializers, Relaters, and Thinkers. I can relate that person to Socializer, and I learnt that I followed some of the guidelines in the book, but I missed others. I would have more strategies to help them out. I applied this principle at LifeLabs. I could identify different personal styles and manage to work with them better.\nI will continue to learn business psychology in the new job position to ensure the smooth and successful running of the laboratory.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/posts/Effective_communication_competency_descriptions/","title":"Effective Communication","section":"Posts","content":"• Seeks the input of others.\n• Listens to acquire essential information.\n• Asks questions to confirm own understanding.\n• Seeks to understand others’ frame of reference.\n• Conveys messages clearly and concisely using appropriate vocabulary and a respectful tone.\n• Displays consistency between verbal and non-verbal message.\n• Listens without interrupting or judging.\n• Demonstrates empathy (e.g. acknowledges others’ feelings and concerns and expresses understanding of others’ situation).\n• Accurately summarizes others’ key points and takes them into account in one’s own communications.\n• Facilitates mutual understanding by rephrasing, summarizing, probing for more information, and/or adjusting own language and behaviours.\n• Presents complex and technical material or ideas in a manner others can easily follow and understand.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/posts/Acountability_CGC_2022/","title":"Hold Accountability","section":"Posts","content":"EC4.1 Describe a time at work when you had to hold a direct report accountable for their actions and/or behaviors as what they were doing was not consistent with your expectations.

Why you chose this example to demonstrate your competency in planning, organizing, and coordinating.\nThe situation in the year 2015 at AECL demonstrated my ability to manage simultaneous work tasks and multiple people. Here were multiple tasks:\nGot testing results out. Many internal clients expected results. Led the revision of the Quality Manual because I was the author of the previous version. Stakeholders across the company were involved, including our section, my manager, QA officers at the local facility, QA officers at the branch level, senior QA officers at the cooperate level, and senior managers at the cooperate level. They expected to review it in the document management system. The accreditation agency expected it before arranging an audit. Routine tasks. I have used these techniques and tools to manage the tasks.\nCoordination, engagement, and collaboration. I collaborated with a primary QA officer at the cooperate level to re-write the Quality Manual. I leveraged the primary QA officer\u0026rsquo;s influence to engage senior managers to approve the document in the document management system as quickly as possible. Plan and teamwork. Technologists organized and re-allocated workloads to tackle the multiple tasks. I monitored the progress. Improved operational efficiency proactively. I developed some computer programs in 2013 to process raw data and review data automatically. It saved my time from reviewing analysis results. Task organization. I set priorities for multiple tasks and used the Outlook calendar to manage my time and tasks. I managed stakeholders\u0026rsquo; expectations by keeping them updated on progress and unexpected difficulties ahead of time and holding ourselves accountable.\nThe outcomes:\nWe met the most expectations of clients for testing. We submitted the requested documents two weeks late with exemption to the accreditation body. They executed the audit on schedule. The external audit went successfully. Evaluation of the quality of the outcomes: The section received the company-wide recognition award for successful re-accreditation. It demonstrated our commitment to maintaining the lab accreditation.\nWhat I would do differently next time: I could use different ways of engaging others to commit to assignments.\nWhat I would continue to do next time:\nI did not expect to get a company-wide recognition award. I feel my efforts were recognized, and it was an effective tool to motivate me to do the job. I will do the same thing to my team in future. I would continue to improve operational efficiency proactively. The reason I chose this example:\nThe project of re-writing the Quality Manual took a lot less time than an average document revision. I was able to manage multiple tasks and lead the project by planning, organizing, and coordinating stakeholders in different groups at different sites across the company. Contact: Neil Peitsch.

I had submitted requests in the action-plan system many times, but I did not get responses, even though I knew the requests were assigned to the responsible front-line managers at the IT group. The difficulty I encountered were: 1) our service request was not the top priority from the IT perspective; 2) the IT group was under reconstruction. They had limited resources to help us.\nI knew it would be impossible for me to engage the manager of the IT group in our service requests. I went to seek the support of our manager. I explained to the manager that we spent about CDN$60k to purchase the software at one point and about CDN$8k every year for service; however, the LIMS was not working properly. With the understanding of the serious problem, our manager contacted the manager of the IT group right away. As a result, a delegated IT staff helped us to walk us through the process of installing updates.\nThis example demonstrated:\nI never gave up on facing difficulties and overcoming barriers.

Some targeted steroids were lost.\nI was recommended using this SPE method which was initially developed for the testing of steroids in serum. I had to make a new method for my application.\nHere is what I did:\nI consulted with a medical scientist to analyze the problem\u0026rsquo;s root cause and come up with solutions. I reviewed potential variables that could contribute to the losses and ended up shortlisting four SPE sorbents, three washing reagents, and two eluting reagents for experiments. I learned to program the SPE method on the automated SPE station so that I could customize the configuration of each step and optimize the SPE method to meet the experiment requirements. I applied the principles of the Design of Experiments for my experiments. The experimental data were more meaningful. I ended up developing a new SPE method that was fit for my case. My team lead was amazed that I managed to design experiments for a complex project and presented experimental processes and experimental data that was easy to follow.\nIt was a significant obstacle for me, considering I had no experience with the automated SPE before. However, I turned it into an achievement.\nThis example demonstrates:\nmy ability to design experiments for complex projects my versatile skills in data processing, data analysis, and data interpretation my resilience in overcoming new challenges.

The goal was to transform the facility into a sample depot by maintaining the minimum analysis and ship most of the samples down to the Testmark facility in Sudbury, ON, as soon as possible. I was promoted to laboratory manager to lead the team through the transition process.\nThe first challenge was to reform the team and reorganize the activities. The number of staff was downsized from 10 to 3. Here is what I did:\nI redeployed one staff from lab operation to customer service. The new job made the staff motivated I hired seasonal workers to cope with the high volume of samples. Besides routine analysis, sample shipment became the top priority - samples were sent out the same day we received them. We needed to log in samples, confirm sampling requirements, make sub-samples, and prepare documents before shipments. I had a meeting at the very beginning with three staff: one lab technician was responsible for microbiological tests, one lab technician was responsible for chemical tests, and another staff was responsible for customer service. I set up the expectations, laid out the workflow, listed to-do items, and opened the floor for discussion. At the end of the meeting, we came up with a plan, and everyone was clear about their tasks. I then summarized it with meeting minutes. During the routine, I followed up with them on a regular base and made adjustments accordingly. I always stayed late to ensure samples got sent down by Purolator or Greyhound bus. I asked the new owner for a monetary incentive to schedule staff for work on weekends. With the new owner\u0026rsquo;s approval, the staff coming to work on weekends for a couple of hours got the whole day\u0026rsquo;s pay. The second challenge was to implement Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). We were requested to use it even though the new features were kept added to the LIMS. Here is what I did:\nI managed to train staff with patience understanding their frustration dealing with ongoing change. I coordinated with the vendor of LIMS to provide feedback and help to install new updates for glitches. I worked with the financial director to sort out financial features on the LIMS. We got the transition done within about one year. I handed over the smooth lab operation to the new lab manager.\nLooking back, one thing I could do differently was to get collective input on planning and organizing for some situations. It was when I joined AECL that I started to do so. It could be a way to motivate staff and uplift team morale.\nContact: Ron Zager email: ronzager@hotmail.com\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/posts/Planning_competency_descriptions/","title":"Planning, Organizing, and Coordinating","section":"Posts","content":"• Seeks objectives for priorities as needed.\n• Sets timelines and work steps.\n• Uses time, energy and available resources efficiently and responsibly.\n• Stays focused on task to meet established deadlines.\n• Monitors the quality and timeliness of own work.\n• Brings work priority conflicts to the attention of a decision-maker.\n• Identifies when to stop investing time, energy and resources in a task.\n• Identifies who will do what and when, taking into account group members’ skills, needs and, if possible, preferences.\n• Identifies varied resources needed (e.g., different types of expenditures, different skill mixes).\n• Breaks activities into smaller components to facilitate completion.\n• Evaluates the extent to which the objective has been achieved.\n• Makes needed adjustments to timelines, steps and resource allocation.\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/posts/Results_oriented_competency_descriptions/","title":"Results Oriented","section":"Posts","content":"• Demonstrates understanding of, and works to meet, predetermined standards.\n• Maintains focus on desired result.\n• Promptly and efficiently completes work assignments.\n• Defines ambitious but realistic goals with specific objectives, and measures own results against them.\n• Evaluates own progress and adjusts actions to meet expectations • Helps others improve their efficiency.\n• Helps others to maintain focus on the achievement of established goals or solutions.\n• Helps others complete tasks or projects so that customer expectations and organizational requirements are met or exceeded.\n"},{"id":44,"href":"/posts/Supervise_team_CGC_2022/","title":"Supervision","section":"Posts","content":"EC1.2 You are supervising a team of 4 technicians.

I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.\nThe experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable. What did we do? A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps. Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis. I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step. Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol.\nWe did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further. It was the risk.\nMy team lead and I decided to take a chance. I read through lots of literature, designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis with solvolysis, and methanolysis, set up instrument configurations, and ran experiments. To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late to work around the medical lab technologists\u0026rsquo; schedule using the automated SPE station.\nI managed to finish the project within two months.

The example should showcase your skills and abilities.\nThe Best Answers to Tough Interview Questions\nTell me about yourself. This is really more of a request than a question. But these few words can put you on the spot in a way no question can. Many quickly lose control of the interview during the most critical time- the first five minutes. This is not the time to go into a lengthy history or wander off in different directions. Your response should be focused and purposeful. Communicate a pattern of interests and skills that relate to the position in question. Consider your response to this question as a commercial that sells your autobiography. Provide an answer that includes information about where you grew up, where you went to school, your initial work experience, additional education and special training, where you are now, and what you intend to do next. One of the most effective ways to prepare for this question is to develop a 60-second biographic sketch that emphasizes a pattern of interests, skills, and accomplishments. Focus your response around a common theme related to your major interests and skills. Take, for example, the following response, which emphasizes computers. \u0026ldquo;I was born in Canton, Ohio and attended Lincoln High School. Ever since I was a teenager, I tinkered with computers. It was my hobby, my passion, and my way of learning. Like most kids I enjoyed computer games. When my folks gave me a computer as a reward for making honor roll my sophomore year, I mastered DOS, Windows, and WordPerfect within six months. I then went on to teach myself programming basics. By the time I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to study programming. From that point on, everything fell into place. My life revolved around computing. By my junior year at Syracuse, I decided I wanted to work for a major software manufacturer. That is why I had an internship last summer at FastTrack Software. I now want to work for a major player so I can be at the forefront of breaking trends and new technology. When my college roommate told me about his start in your department, I hounded him until he helped me get a referral, which brought me here today. I am prepared to answer any questions you may have about my education and experience.\u0026rdquo; This response sets a nice tone for starting the interview. The interviewee is able to say a lot within 60 seconds by staying focused. The message is clear: the interviewee has both passion and focus relating to the position. He stays on message and concludes by leaving the door open for additional questions about his education and experience. Unfortunately some candidates get off on the wrong foot by rambling on for several minutes about their childhood, family, hobbies, travels, and interests. Repeat Key Accomplishment Statements Throughout the interview you will be asked numerous questions about your attitude and ability to do the job. Whenever possible, talk about your accomplishments in terms of what you did and the results of your actions for employers. Give examples of your effectiveness, which should include specific skills and statistics.\nWhere do you see yourself five years from now? This open-ended question is one of the most difficult and stressful ones job seekers face. Employers ostensibly ask this question because they are looking for people who know what they want to do and who are focused on specific professional goals. If you lack goals, you will have difficulty answering this question. Be sure you arrive at the interview with a clear vision of what you want to do today, tomorrow and five years from now. Be consistent with the objective on your resume and the skills and accomplishments you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to the interviewer. Your answer should be employer-centered. For example, \u0026ldquo;In five years I hope to be working with an employer in an increasingly responsible position, that enables me to utilize my talents and work closely with my colleagues in solving important problems. I see myself taking on new and exciting challenges in an enjoyable environment and hopefully this will be with your company.\u0026rdquo; Do not indicate that you hope to start your own business, change careers, or go back to school. Such responses indicate a lack of long-term interest since you do not plan to be around for long. While some may respond that they honestly haven\u0026rsquo;t really thought that far ahead, the interviewer infers that the applicant lacks vision and goals.\nDescribe a major goal you\u0026rsquo;ve set for yourself recently. Give an example of a goal you both set and achieved. Ideally, this should be a professional goal; such as improved time management skills, achieved new performance targets, or learned a new skill. A personal example can also be appropriate if it reinforces your pattern of accomplishments. For example, if you take a great deal of initiative and quickly move into leadership positions, you might use a personal example relating to your recent community work: organized a community walk-a-thon that raised $30,000 in matching funds to purchase new computers for the local library.

The example should showcase your skills and abilities.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to learn more about us, what would you change about our company? Be careful here.

At the same time, they don\u0026rsquo;t want someone who says, \u0026ldquo;Nothing, everything looks great here.\u0026rdquo; Seek a middle ground by focusing on one or two non-threatening issues that may have come up in your discussions. For example, \u0026ldquo;From our discussion of the problem with the southwest accounts, I think we should look into the possibility of consolidating them the LA office. However, I think we need to do a thorough cost-benefit analysis of this region before making such a move. We may find the Phoenix office to be more beneficial.\u0026rdquo; Such an answer indicates you are open to making changes but you also have a certain non-threatening decision-making style. Your response should sound sensible and innovative. \\\nWe all have weaknesses. What are some of your major weaknesses? This is not the time to confess all your problems nor to confidently say you have no weaknesses. The best way to handle this question is to mention personal weaknesses that are outside the job or a professional weakness that you have already improved upon. For example, \u0026ldquo;I have a real weakness for chocolate that tends to go right to my waist! I\u0026rsquo;m watching my calories carefully these days!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never been good with accounting. I\u0026rsquo;m glad this job doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve accounting.\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;I have a tendency to take on too much on my own. I am working on this by delegating more.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat type of decisions do you have difficulty making? Show that you are generally decisive but mention that there are situations that give you time to pause or you are learning how to better make decisions. For example, \u0026ldquo;I sometimes have difficulty choosing between two equally good ideas.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I used to have difficulty saying \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo; to people until I learned to better set priorities.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is your biggest failure? Focus on something outside your work or something that happened on the job that you later fixed. Do not admit to any personal quality that might hamper job performance, such as procrastination, laziness or lack of concentration. Choose something that will not reflect badly on your ability to perform in the given position, such as one that took place early in your career. For example, \u0026ldquo;My biggest failure was not being selected as a SEAL because I was diagnosed with night vision problems. When I was 18, all I wanted to be was a SEAL. But I\u0026rsquo;m glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t, because I may have overlooked an exciting career in information technology\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When I was working at CL Advertising Associates, I lost the $2 million Jettler account after only six weeks on the job! I felt awful and thought I would be fired. I was determined to get the account back and did after six months. Today the account makes up 1/3 of CL Advertising.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat are the major reasons for your success? This is not the time to become extremely self-centered and arrogant. Keep in mind that employers are often looking for team players rather than Lone Rangers. A good response to this question may relate to a mentor/and or philosophy of work or the people you work with. Also, use this question as an opportunity to inquire about an appropriate \u0026ldquo;fit for success\u0026rdquo; with this company. For example, \u0026ldquo;Many years ago I learned an important lesson from Bob Nelson, who was my first supervisor and really became my most important mentor. He told me his secret to success was to \u0026lsquo;Look at each day as a new opportunity to be your very best. Set high goals, be honest, never say no, and work with people who share your passion for doing their best.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve always remembered that advice and try to live it every day. I am very self motivated, determined and honest. I really love what I do and I try to surround myself with people who share similar passions. I thrive on this type of environment. Am I likely to find this environment with your company? Can you tell me a little more about the characteristics of successful people at your company? What do you see as some of the key success factors for this position?\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;re considering two other candidates for this position. Why should we hire you rather than someone else? Do not be distracted by the mention of two other candidates, you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about them and they could be fictitious. Focus on what strengths you bring to the table. These should be consistent with the four things most employers are looking for in candidates during the job interview: competence, professionalism, enthusiasm, and likability. Remember, they are looking for chemistry between you and them. Be prepared to summarize in 60 seconds why you are the best candidate for the job. Also, let the employer know you want the job and you will enjoy working with them. A lack of interest in the job may indicate a lack of enthusiasm for the job and them. How do you spend your free time? This question may have several purposes. The interviewer may be just curious about your personal life without getting into illegal questions. He may also want to know how well rounded you are in your personal and professional lives. Focus on some of the standard hobbies or activities that most people engage in: golf, tennis, boating, reading, music, opera, collecting, gardening, or cooking. If you are operating a home-based business as a sideline, you may not want to reveal your entrepreneurial spirit-it may indicate you are planning to leave and go solo as soon as the business starts doing well. Source: Haldane\u0026rsquo;s Best Answers to Tough Interview Questions, Bernard Haldane Associates, 2000. Why do you want to work in this industry? Tell a story about how you first became interested in this type of work. Point out any similarities between the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for and your current or most recent job. Provide proof that you aren\u0026rsquo;t simply shopping in this interview. Make your passions for you work a theme that you allude to continually throughout the interview. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to work in an industry that makes tools. One of my hobbies is home-improvement projects, so I\u0026rsquo;ve collected a number of saws manufactured by your company. I could be an accountant anywhere, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather work for a company whose products I trust.\u0026rdquo; How do you stay current? Demonstrate natural interest in the industry or career field by describing publications or trade associations that are compatible with your goal. \u0026ldquo;I pore over the Wall Street Journal, the Times, Institutional Investor, and several mutual fund newsletters. And I have a number of friends who are analysts.\u0026rdquo; Why do you think this industry would sustain your interest in the long haul? What expectations or projects do you have for the business that would enable you to grow without necessarily advancing? What excites you about the business? What proof can you offer that your interest has already come from a deep curiosity-perhaps going back at least a few years-rather than a current whim you\u0026rsquo;ll outgrow? \u0026ldquo;The technology in the industry is changing so rapidly that I see lots of room for job enhancement regardless of promotions. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in the many applications for multimedia as a training tool.\u0026rdquo; Where do you want to be in five years? Don\u0026rsquo;t give specific time frames or job titles. Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you\u0026rsquo;d expect in your chosen field or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t discuss your goals in a fields or industry unrelated to the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for. This may sound obvious, but too many candidates make this mistake, unwittingly demonstrating a real lack of interest in their current field or industry. Needless to say, such a gaffe will immediately eliminate you from further consideration. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to have the opportunity to work in a plant as well as at the home office. I also hope to develop my management skills, perhaps by managing a small staff.\u0026rdquo; Describe your ideal career. Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you\u0026rsquo;d expect in this particular job or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. Avoid mentioning specific time frames or job titles. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to stay in a field related to training no matter what happens. I was too interested in business to work at a university, but I believe that teaching is somehow in my blood. I\u0026rsquo;ve been good at sales because I took the time to educate my clients. Now I look forward to training the new hires.\u0026rdquo; Tell me something about yourself that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know from reading your resume. Don\u0026rsquo;t just repeat what\u0026rsquo;s on your resume. Think of a talent or skill that didn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit into your employment history, but that\u0026rsquo;s unique and reveals something intriguing about your personality or past experience. \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ve managed my own small portfolio since I was sixteen, but I believe that it\u0026rsquo;s important for you to understand my interest in investment sales. I\u0026rsquo;ve averaged a 12 percent return over the past eight years.\u0026rdquo; Tell me what you know about this company. Describe your first encounter or a recent encounter with the company or its products and services. What would be particularly motivating to you about working there as opposed to working the same type of job in a different company? The recruiter will look for evidence of genuine interest and more than just surface research on the company. Reciting the annual report isn\u0026rsquo;t likely to impress most recruiters, but feedback from customers and employees will. \u0026ldquo;I served as an intern to a restaurant analyst last summer, so I followed all the steak-house chains closely. What you\u0026rsquo;ve done especially well is focus on a limited menu with great consistency among locations; the business traveler trusts your product anywhere in the U.S. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in your real-estate finance group and expansion plans.\u0026rdquo; What have you learned about our company from customers, employees, or others? Describe how your interest has grown from personal dealings with the company representatives. Think creatively in preparing for job interviews. For example, prior to your job interview, speak with retailers or workers at other distribution points about the company\u0026rsquo;s product line. What can they tell you? Give one or two examples of what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to explain why you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this company. What\u0026rsquo;s the most compelling example you can describe to prove your interest? \u0026ldquo;I actually called several of the key accountants mentioned in your brochure. Two of the customers I spoke with explained why they continued to buy from you year after year. Your distribution operation is phenomenal. Are there any service improvements you think could still be made?\u0026rdquo; Tell me what you think our distinctive advantage is within the industry. Describe things you believe the company does very well, particularly compared to its competition. Explain how the financial strength of the company is important. \u0026ldquo;With your low-cost-producer status and headquarters operation in a low-cost area of the country, you seem in a better position to be able to spend aggressively on R\u0026amp;D, even in a down year compared to your closest rival.\u0026rdquo; What other firms are you interviewing with, and for what positions? Often the candidate will try to impress the employer by naming some large firms in unrelated industries with completely different types of jobs. This is a big mistake! What employers want to hear is that you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for similar jobs in the same industry at similar firms (such as their competitors). This illustrates that you\u0026rsquo;re committed to finding a job in your field of interest and are likely to be a low-risk hire. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely decided to pursue a career as a restaurant manager, so I\u0026rsquo;m applying for restaurant management-training programs. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently had interviews with several other large national fast-food chains, such as Super Burger and Clackey\u0026rsquo;s Chicken.\u0026rdquo; Do you believe you\u0026rsquo;re overqualified for this position? Most people don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be asked if they have a great deal of experience. This question could quite easily catch a candidate off guard, which is exactly the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s intention. The candidate doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate in answering this question and shows complete confidence in his or her ability. \u0026ldquo;Not at all. My experience and qualifications make me do my job only better, and in my opinion, my good design skills help to sell more books. My business experience helps me run the art department in a cost-efficient manner, thus saving the company money. Finally, I think I\u0026rsquo;m able to attract better freelance talent because of all my industry contacts. My qualifications are better for your company, too, since you\u0026rsquo;ll be getting a better return for your investment. Again, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in establishing a long-term relationship with my employer, and if I did well, I would expect expanded responsibilities that could make use of even other skills.\u0026rdquo; What would you do if one of our competitors offered you a position? The interviewer is trying to determine whether the candidate is truly interested in the industry and company, or whether he or she has chosen the company randomly. Contrast your perceptions of the company with its competitors, and talk about the company\u0026rsquo;s products or services that you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered. In the long run, which players do you believe are most viable and why? This is also a good place to ask the interviewer for his or her opinion. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say no. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in other players in this industry. I want to work for Nike because I won a number of races wearing the Nike brand. Because of my positive experience with Nike, I know I\u0026rsquo;d be convincing selling your product to retailers.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your dream job? This is your ideal chance to sell your aptitudes that fit the job description. Show an interest in finding new ways these skills can be put to use in a new job with additional responsibilities. Tie in the industry, size of company, or other factors where appropriate. \u0026ldquo;My dream job would include all of the responsibilities and duties in this position you\u0026rsquo;re trying to fill. I also thrive in a fast-changing environment where there\u0026rsquo;s business growth. Your plans call for expanding internationally during the next year, and this would satisfy one of my ultimate goals of being involved in an international corporation.\u0026rdquo; What motivates you to do this kind of work? The interviewer will want to know about your belief in the products or services of the company. Use personal experience to demonstrate your interests and strengths. In an interview for your ideal job, you\u0026rsquo;d be highly motivated to get paid for working at something you liked. The interviewer will want to know if your natural interests are compatible with its particular job. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate in my own schooling; I had wonderful teachers. I want to be that same kind of teacher-who not only encourages kids to learn but also sets an example that inspires others to want to teach. In the long run, that\u0026rsquo;s our best chance of turning around the quality of education in this state.\u0026rdquo; Why should I hire you? Don\u0026rsquo;t repeat your resume or employment history. Offer one or two examples to explain why you\u0026rsquo;re talking to this particular company. What\u0026rsquo;s the most compelling example you can give to prove your interest? This question often remains unasked, but it\u0026rsquo;s always in the back of the recruiter\u0026rsquo;s mind. Even if this question isn\u0026rsquo;t asked, you should find an opportunity to use your prepared response sometime during the interview, perhaps in your closing remarks. \u0026ldquo;My uncle had a company that was a small-scale manufacturer in the industry, and although he later sold the business, I worked there for five summers doing all sorts of odd jobs. For that reason I believe I know this business from the ground up, and you can be assured that I know what I\u0026rsquo;d be getting into as a plant manager here.\u0026rdquo; What are your strengths? Describe two or three skills you have that are most relevant to the job. Avoid clich�s or generalities; offer specific evidence. Describe new ways these skills could be put to use in the new position. If you have to talk about weaknesses, be honest without shooting yourself in the foot-avoid pointing out a weakness that could be a major obstacle in landing the job. For example, it might be wise to mention you barely have the required work experience for the job; the interviewer has surely noticed this much, and then you can explain how you\u0026rsquo;re qualified nonetheless. \u0026ldquo;My strengths are interpersonal skills, and I can usually win people over to my point of view. Also, I have good judgment about people and an intuitive sense of their talents and their ability to contribute to a given problem. These skills seem to me directly related to the job. I notice that you require three years\u0026rsquo; work experience for this job. Although my resume shows I\u0026rsquo;ve only two years\u0026rsquo; experience, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show that I took two evening college courses related to my field and have been active in one of the professional societies. I also try to gain knowledge by reading the industry\u0026rsquo;s trade journals. I\u0026rsquo;m certain that my combined knowledge and skill level is the equivalent of that of other people who do have three years\u0026rsquo; of work experience. I\u0026rsquo;m also currently enrolled in a time-management course; I can already see the effects of this course at work on my present job.\u0026rdquo; How do you explain your job success? Be candid without sounding arrogant. Mention observations other people have made about your work strengths or talents. This question is similar to the question \u0026ldquo;What sets you apart from the crowd?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I never assume our customers are satisfied with our product, so I do my best to follow up with every customer. This feedback has provided valuable insight into the quality and characteristics of our products. The customer, as well, always appreciates this follow-up, especially when something hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone right and you still have the opportunity to correct it on a timely basis. In addition, I\u0026rsquo;m able to pass on information to our design and production units to help improve both process and product.\u0026rdquo; Would your current boss describe you as the kind of employee who goes the extra mile? Be ready to offer proof that you persevere to see important projects through and to achieve important results. Share an example that demonstrates your dependability or willingness to tackle a tough project. If you describe \u0026ldquo;long hours of work,\u0026rdquo; make sure you demonstrate that the hours were productive, and not just the result of poor time management. \u0026ldquo;Absolutely. In fact, on my annual evaluations she writes that I\u0026rsquo;m the most dependable and flexible person on her staff. I think this is mostly because of my ability to juggle and prioritize. Would you like an example?\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a time you didn\u0026rsquo;t perform to your capabilities. This question forces the candidate to describe a negative situation. Do so in the context of an early career mistake based on inexperience; then demonstrate the better judgment you now have as a result of that learning experience. \u0026ldquo;The first time I had to give a presentation to our board, I failed to anticipate some of their questions. I was unprepared for anything other than what I wanted to report. Now my director and I brainstorm all the what-ifs in advance.\u0026rdquo; How do you manage stress in your daily work? It might be helpful here to describe a stressful project you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on and the specific actions you took to organize each step and see the project through. How do you keep yourself calm and professional under pressure? \u0026ldquo;I try to get out for lunch at least once during the week to clear my head. I also have a personal rule that stops me from reacting to a problem until I feel calm about it. I think, then act-but I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to do that over time.\u0026rdquo; How do you regroup when things haven\u0026rsquo;t gone as planned? Describe a time when some obstacle forced you to change your original plan, but you were still able to achieve the desired result. Did you rally the support of others to make this happen? With hindsight, how might you have better predicted the obstacle? \u0026ldquo;I start by trying to imagine the worst possible outcome; then I back up and identify precautions I can take to avoid that scenario. In this way I usually end up with a result close to the original goal. The training example I described earlier is proof of that skill.\u0026rdquo; Why is service such an important issue? The interviewer is trying to determine if the candidate understands the importance of customer service in establishing a positive image in the marketplace, and its impact on new business sales. Outstanding customer service is also a great help in establishing long-term clients and repeat business-the profitable company\u0026rsquo;s bread and butter. The longer the relationship, the greater the possibility for profit. \u0026ldquo;Service is a major contributor to customer satisfaction. Just as important as, or maybe even more important than, cost. If a customer isn\u0026rsquo;t receiving a level of service that meets or exceeds his or her expectations, that customer won\u0026rsquo;t be a customer for very long. In addition, that customer\u0026rsquo;s experience with your company may affect how potential customers in the marketplace view your company. People do talk and share information. This may affect not only profits but future sales as well. In many instances service may be the one thing that distinguishes a company from the competition. A bad reputation for service may compromise a company\u0026rsquo;s position in the marketplace.\u0026rdquo;\nTell me about a time when you had to deal with an irate customer. How did you handle the situation?\nHow you react when others lose their temper or become upset is very important in most positions, especially those in service industries. The interviewer will be looking for evidence of your aptitude for work that involves a great deal of contact with the public. Give an example of a time when you were faced with a difficult person and how you handled it. Your answer should illustrate your maturity, diplomacy, and awareness of the needs and feelings of others.\n\u0026ldquo;My customer service position at the telephone company involved dealing occasionally with irate customers. When that happened, I\u0026rsquo;d try to talk in a calm, even voice, in order to get the person to respond in a businesslike manner and focus on trying to resolve the situation. Most times I was able to rectify the problem and pacify the customer, but I remember one incident in particular in which the caller became verbally abusive. I tried to remain calm and professional and not to let my personal feelings enter into the situation. I didn\u0026rsquo;t respond to the abuse, I just made a not of it and continued to help he customer as best I could. When the abuse persisted, however, I politely asked him to call back and ask for my manager, because at that point I knew I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t resolve the problem.\u0026rdquo;\nHow do you manage your work week and make realistic deadlines?\nTo answer this question effectively, describe in detail how you establish priorities, set deadlines, and determine schedules. \u0026ldquo;I always reserve two hours of dead time every day to handle any unanticipated problems that may occur. I used to plan for eight or nine hours of project time, but now I find that I\u0026rsquo;m able to manage my own projects, as well as whatever my boss and staff need from me.\u0026rdquo; What personal skill or work habit have you struggled to improve? This question is similar to \u0026ldquo;Describe a professional skill you\u0026rsquo;ve developed in your most recent job.\u0026rdquo; However, here you probably want to discuss an improvement from the earliest days of your career or from your relatively distant past. Make sure you convince the interviewer that this particular work habit is no longer an obstacle. \u0026ldquo;I had to learn to say no. I used to be helpful to the point that other staff abused my goodwill. Now I offer to help by countering with something I\u0026rsquo;d like help on in return. On balance I believe the trade-off is more equitable, and cooperation in our office has improved over time.\u0026rdquo; What color is your brain? Be aware that you\u0026rsquo;ll probably be asked zany questions. The point is not to stump you, but to find out what makes you tick. When the standard interview questions are asked, people are prepared, and it\u0026rsquo;s harder for the recruiter to get to know the real person. An advertising recruiter, for example, tries to avoid this. There is no right or wrong answer to this type of question. In fact, the recruiter won\u0026rsquo;t even really care what your answer is. He or she just doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear something like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s blue because that\u0026rsquo;s the way I imagine it.\u0026rdquo; The point is to see how creative you are and how you think. Be sure to explain why you answered the way you did. \u0026ldquo;My brain is red because I\u0026rsquo;m always hot. I\u0026rsquo;m always on fire with new plans and ideas.\u0026rdquo; If you got on an elevator where everyone was facing the back, what would you do? Interviews in creative fields like advertising and graphic design are different from other types of job interviews. Advertising recruiters tend to have a different interview style and process, usually conducting more of a behavioral interview. Recruiters ask questions like these to figure out what your behavior might be in a particular real-life situation. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;d face the front anyway and say aloud, \u0026lsquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really much more comfortable facing forward, you know.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot; What\u0026rsquo;s the most creative or innovative project you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on? Provide examples of your initiative and resourcefulness. Discuss how your leadership skills have helped you accomplish your goals. Give a specific example that shows a creative, new, or unusual approach to reaching your goals. \u0026ldquo;During my summer job at Cellular One, I noticed that the sales inquiries were distributed haphazardly to all the marketing assistants in the office. I decided to set up a system grouping inquiries according to region or according to company size. This approach enabled the entire marketing team to come up with better and more creative solutions to our sales problems.\u0026rdquo; Consider the following scenario: You\u0026rsquo;re working late one evening and are the last person in the office. You answer an urgent telephone call to your supervisor from a sales rep who\u0026rsquo;s currently meeting with a potential client. The sales rep needs an answer to a question to close the sale. Tomorrow will be too late. You have the expertise to answer the question, but it\u0026rsquo;s beyond your normal level of authority. How do you respond? This response shows that the candidate is confident in his or her ability and can be counted on in an emergency. Similarly, your answer should indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re not afraid to be the decision maker in a tough situation, even if the situation\u0026rsquo;s beyond your normal level of authority. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d get all the pertinent information, taking well-documented notes. I\u0026rsquo;d answer the question based on my knowledge and the information provided. I\u0026rsquo;d leave my supervisor a note and fill him or her in on the details the next morning. I\u0026rsquo;d be sure to explain my decision, as well as the thought process behind it.\u0026rdquo; Give me proof of your persuasiveness. This is a question about leadership, but try not to use an example in which you were the designated leader. If possible, describe a time when you didn\u0026rsquo;t really have authority but instead used your powers of persuasion to get people on your side. Describe your goal and the outcome of your efforts. Why did people trust or believe you? \u0026ldquo;During my summer internship I was assigned the task of conducting a benchmarking study for all the communication expenditures for a major utility. I had to get the consensus of employees in several different departments. Unfortunately, they resented the fact that I was just a summer intern, and they refused to cooperate. I had to schedule individual meetings with every employee and persuade each one that I was doing what would be ultimately to his or her own department and to the company. After a frustrating month, I finally got everyone\u0026rsquo;s cooperation, the project went flawlessly, and in the end I received a bonus for my efforts.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your most productive or ideal work setting? The interviewer wants to know the impact that the candidate\u0026rsquo;s working environment has on his or her job performance. How well would you fit the position, physical layout of the department, and attitudes of the particular work group? Emphasize your ability to work in a variety of settings and how you\u0026rsquo;ve managed to be productive in less-than-ideal work environments. \u0026ldquo;I like having at least one hour of uninterrupted time in the early morning to plan my day. I usually start around 7 a.m. Otherwise, I enjoy an office with open doors, constant feedback, and lots of energy and activity. It helps me work more productively when I sense how busy everyone else is, too.\u0026rdquo; Do you prefer continuity in structure or frequent change in your daily work? Your answer should be consistent with the job description. Describe environments that have allowed you to remain interested and learn new things without getting bored. \u0026ldquo;I enjoy challenge and change, which is why I frequently ask for the tough assignments. The last two projects we discussed were ones that I asked for. I don\u0026rsquo;t allow myself to get bored.\u0026rdquo; What environments allow you to be especially effective? Emphasize your flexibility and your ability to work in many different types of environments. Your answer should not consist of a laundry list of requirements (private office, few interruptions, and so on) or the interviewer may conclude that you will be difficult to satisfy. \u0026ldquo;Although I can work effectively in most environments, I prefer environments where people are their own bosses, within reason. I like to have a goal but be able to draw my own map to get there. To accomplish goals, I rely on asking questions and finding people receptive, so cooperation and access are important to me in a work group.\u0026rdquo; How will you complement this department? Describe how your personality and/or skills would help round out the department. What types of people enjoy working with you for hours at a time? How would the company\u0026rsquo;s customers or clients react? Assure the interviewer that there will be no surprises about your work personality. \u0026ldquo;I enjoy an environment in which people bounce ideas off each other and have the flexibility to ask for help when they need it. I\u0026rsquo;m usually a great troubleshooter for PC problems in my office, and I\u0026rsquo;m often going to ask for help proofreading important memos. I believe in give-and-take.\u0026rdquo; Whom did you choose as your references and why? The interviewer is looking for a logical mix of people without any obvious omissions. For example, a former sales person would do well to include a former salesperson as a reference. Describe what you\u0026rsquo;d expect each of your references to say. Include a diverse group-senior to junior, an associate from work, and old professor from college. \u0026ldquo;I selected a former boss, a peer, and customer as references, to demonstrate that I\u0026rsquo;m a pretty well-rounded person and get along with all the important work associates in my life.\u0026rdquo; Can we call all of your references? This is a question designed to protect you. If your current job employer doesn\u0026rsquo;t know your looking for a new job (as is most often the case), you can request that the interviewer contact your current employer after you\u0026rsquo;ve accepted a position and given your notice to your current employer. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d prefer that you call my current boss only after you\u0026rsquo;ve made me a firm offer of employment and I\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to tell her myself that I\u0026rsquo;m changing jobs. Then, of course, I understand your need to verify that my application was accurate.\u0026rdquo; Are you most productive working alone or in a group? The interviewer is looking for someone who can work in an environment without the environment disrupting the candidate\u0026rsquo;s preferred way of getting work done. Be honest but communicate that you\u0026rsquo;re a flexible and reasonably adaptable employee. \u0026ldquo;I need some privacy time for planning, but otherwise I like the activity and noise of people around me and the ability to share ideas. I think most writers need reinforcement, because we all get writer\u0026rsquo;s block occasionally.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about an effective manager, supervisor, or other person in a leading role you\u0026rsquo;ve known. Talk about a supervisor\u0026rsquo;s management style and interpersonal skills. Focus on the positive-how the person worked rather than what type of work he or she did. How was the person able to accomplish so much and get your support? \u0026ldquo;The best professor I ever had always reviewed the most important points from our last class before he moved on to new material. He also watched our faces carefully and repeated information whenever he saw a blank stare. Sometimes he would just ask for feedback by saying, \u0026lsquo;What are you having difficulty with?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; He never assumed too much or made us feel dumb for not grasping a concept quickly.\u0026rdquo; What type of people do you work with most effectively? Focus on the positive here. What type of boss, employee, and colleague would you be? Keep in mind that the interviewer wants to find out how well you would fit in with the other personalities in the company-not how well the other personalities in the company would suit you. \u0026ldquo;I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and am decisive.\u0026rdquo; What things impress you in colleagues? The recruiter will want to see how developed your interpersonal skills are. More than likely, you\u0026rsquo;ll be interacting not only with your own department, but with other people in the company, and possibly colleagues. Show the recruiter that you will shine in this area. \u0026ldquo;I admire and work best with people who are of good character and have integrity. I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment.\u0026rdquo; How do you organize and plan for major projects? Give the interviewer a good idea of your general approach to mastering complex tasks. You may wish to include here how you decide time frames, set deadlines, determine priorities, delegate tasks, and decide what to do for yourself. \u0026ldquo;I love to brainstorm a best, worst, and most likely scenario. Then I set out a timetable that\u0026rsquo;s realistic. What I usually find is that some combination of my best and worst cases evolves; I can adjust my schedule easily as these things unfold because I\u0026rsquo;ve already visualized what could happen and how I\u0026rsquo;d react.\u0026rdquo; What personal characteristics add to your effectiveness? Talk about what makes your personal style unique and effective. For example, how are you able to get cooperation from others? What specific skills and traits help you get results, and why? \u0026ldquo;I always stay in touch with my network. If I see an article that might be of interest to someone I know, I clip it and send it to that person. Then, when I need help and make a phone call to that person, the phone call gets returned promptly.\u0026rdquo; How have your technical skills been an asset? Describe how you\u0026rsquo;ve used technical skills to solve a problem. Tell a specific story. Demonstrate how these same skills have been useful in other situations or in most of the jobs you\u0026rsquo;ve held. If you\u0026rsquo;re hired, what situations will you handle particularly well? \u0026ldquo;Although I never planned on a career as a writer or publisher, much of my job in marketing has depended on good writing and creative layout skills. My part-time college job with a newspaper taught me a lot about desktop publishing, how to position something on a page effectively, and how to write short sentences with maximum impact. In all of my marketing jobs, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to explain my goals clearly to graphic designers, which has helped me avoid costly design revisions.\u0026rdquo; How do you usually go about solving a problem? The interviewer will want to hear the logic you use to solve problems as well as the outcomes you\u0026rsquo;re able to achieve. Are you decisive? How do you narrow the options and make decisions? What do people say about your reasoning skills? What examples would they cite of your effective decision-making? \u0026ldquo;When I need to solve a problem, I generally start by writing down as many ideas as I can think of about possible causes. Next I look for relationships among causes so I can group together symptoms of bigger problems. Usually, after I study these groups of problems, the real cause becomes readily apparent.\u0026rdquo; How practical or pragmatic are you? Give the interviewer an example of some practical or sensible approach you\u0026rsquo;ve used to solve a problem. When was a simple solution the best solution? Had others overlooked the obvious? In this example, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to show off your commonsense skills rather than your academic skills. \u0026ldquo;I can usually pick up on an underlying problem, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not too obvious. I recall an investment banker who visited our real-estate-finance class and asked us what might cause the Tokyo investment community a problem in attracting local investment dollars. A number of finance students in the class started trying to think of some complicated set of reasons. I decided it would have to do with getting out of a bad market quickly, and that a non-liquid investment would create problems. I said investors would be unsettled if the primary investment is local real estate and inflation has caused the paper value to exaggerate the real street value. As it ended up, that was the answer he wanted.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a time when there was no rule or precedent to help you attack a problem. Can you operate without structure? Describe your problem-solving process, especially the steps you took and measures you established in a particularly trying situation. Demonstrate confidence and the willingness to take on more challenges. \u0026ldquo;I was the first employee in a newly created position. I spent the first week developing an understanding of the history that had led to creation of the position. Only then did a method for setting priorities on the job become clear.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your greatest achievement to date? Be sure that the achievement you describe here is relevant to the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. Also, be careful that your answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound as if the best is behind you. Mention something great that you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved, but clearly communicate your belief that the best is yet to come. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the fact that I graduated on time with a solid GPA while I played varsity basketball for four years. A lot of women on my team either took a reduced course load or let their grades suffer. I believe the reason I got through it all was sheer determination; I never even let myself visualize anything but finishing on time and with good grades. So I firmly believe, as a professional counselor, in the importance of a positive outlook.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about something you accomplished that required discipline. This is your opportunity to discuss a skill you worked to develop, or a time when the quantity of your work required solid time-management skills. How did you remain focused? \u0026ldquo;I had to work two jobs to put myself through graduate school. I interned at the newspaper while I studied journalism during the week. Then on weekends, I sold real estate. Juggling those three schedules was a challenge, but I did it because it was important to me to graduate without school loans.\u0026rdquo; Where do you hope that your career will have progressed to in the next few years? Avoid the temptation to suggest job titles; this makes you seem unbending and unrealistic, since you don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it might have taken your interviewer to reach certain levels, and you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to insult. Describe new experiences or responsibilities you\u0026rsquo;d like to add that build on the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for. \u0026ldquo;Over the next few years I\u0026rsquo;d like to have progressed to the point there I have bottom-line budget responsibility, and I\u0026rsquo;m also in charge of a production unit where I have labor-relations, quality-control, design, and manufacturing responsibilities. I believe this job will go a long way to helping me meet my career goals.\u0026rdquo; Since this will be your first job, how do you know you\u0026rsquo;ll like the career path? This can be a difficult question to answer convincingly, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done a little bit of preparation. Discuss, for example, an internship or a conversation that\u0026rsquo;s allowed you to assess the culture of the organization or to preview the work involved. Describe other people in the profession who have been mentors or who have taught you about the field. Also, point out why you\u0026rsquo;re interested, how you learned more about the industry, and how you stay current with industry trends. \u0026ldquo;Although it\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;ve never worked a job in your industry, I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to many friends and alums at my school who\u0026rsquo;ve been successful in your company. I always ask them questions, \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the most frustrating thing about your job?\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the most rewarding thing about your job?\u0026rsquo; From the information I\u0026rsquo;ve gained, I\u0026rsquo;m confident that I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to adapt quickly to your culture and will find the next few years rewarding, based on my goals and values.\u0026rdquo; What are your aspirations beyond this job? Again, don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the trap of specifying job titles. Stick to a natural progression you see as plausible. How should this job grow for the good of the organization? Then turn your attention once again to the job at hand. If you seem too interested in what lies beyond this job, the interviewer will fear that you won\u0026rsquo;t stick around for long. \u0026ldquo;Beyond this job as a marketing assistant, I see myself moving up through marketing analysis into brand management and eventually running a category. I\u0026rsquo;m aware that there are several skills I need to develop in the interval, and I believe with your continuing-education program and my own motivation for self-improvement, I\u0026rsquo;ll have those skills when the opportunities arise for greater responsibility. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m determined to learn from the ground up, starting as a marketing assistant.\u0026rdquo; How long do you think you\u0026rsquo;d continue to grow in this job? This is a variation on the question, \u0026ldquo;Where do you want to be in five years?\u0026rdquo; Be as specific as you can, considering what you know about the position. Don\u0026rsquo;t mention a job title you\u0026rsquo;d want next, or the interviewer will wonder if you\u0026rsquo;re already preoccupied with moving on. \u0026ldquo;My own personal measure of growth in a job is acquiring new skills, new knowledge, and new insights into the industry. As long as I can measure this type of growth, I consider myself successful. I\u0026rsquo;m a believer in stretching a job by reaching out to learn more about other areas that are peripheral to the job I\u0026rsquo;m in.\u0026rdquo; Compare this job to others you\u0026rsquo;re pursuing. Some consistency or thread of commonality among your other prospects is important here. Your choices must reflect your career aspirations. What common skills are clearly needed in all the jobs you\u0026rsquo;re pursuing? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve narrowed my job search to only those large securities firms within the finance industry. The basic skills necessary with all of these firms are similar: strong quantitative and analytical abilities, the ability to make decisions quickly, and good interpersonal skills to react to a customer\u0026rsquo;s needs.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your salary expectations. A well-prepared candidate can effectively turn this question around. Ask first for the company\u0026rsquo;s salary range, then answer in general terms based on your qualifications in relation to the job requirements. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve become a little frustrated in the past year because the downturn in our industry has caused limited promotional opportunities. Based upon salary information published by our national association, the market price for someone with my experience and educational background is in the broad range of thirty to forty thousand dollars per year. Although I\u0026rsquo;m not certain how your salaries compare to the national norms, my feeling is that my value would certainly be in the upper half of this national range. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll share with me some of your salary ranges relative to the national norms.\u0026rdquo; What do you reasonably expect to earn within five years? Again, turn this question around and ask what\u0026rsquo;s typical for the career path. Then consider, based on your skills and performance, the areas you\u0026rsquo;ll excel in. Leave it to the interviewer the appropriate time frames for promotions. Don\u0026rsquo;t speculate, or you\u0026rsquo;ll risk sounding arrogant, unrealistic, or the opposite-too reserved or too tentative. \u0026ldquo;My expectation for the next five years is that my contributions will be recognized and appropriately rewarded. I realize that salary levels are based on a number of factors, including the company\u0026rsquo;s profitability and the general business cycle that affects our industry, but I expect to take on greater responsibility each year and to be appropriately compensated for my efforts and contributions.\u0026rdquo; Other than work, tell me about an activity you\u0026rsquo;ve remained interested in over several years. The interviewer is looking here for a history of commitment over time, and consistency of interests. Do you sustain your hobbies over a period of time, or do you have a different hobby every year? Are your interests compatible with the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for? Would they be of value in any way to the company? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in Cancer Society fundraising ever since my grandmother died from the disease. In the back of my mind I guess I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the research can lead to findings in time to save the life of someone else in my family.\u0026rdquo; What do you enjoy in your spare time? The interviewer wants evidence that you\u0026rsquo;re well rounded, not just one-dimensional. He or she is looking for shared interests or common ground. You should always, in some way, relate your answer to the job description. \u0026ldquo;I really enjoy getting outside-I often go camping and hiking. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about different fabrics that are good for various weather conditions. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m so interested in your textile operations.\u0026rdquo; Do you live a balanced lifestyle? Do you have an outlet, a way to break from work, so that you show up each day refreshed and ready to perform at your highest level? Describe something specific that allows you to relax. Are your personal and career interests compatible in terms of their logic or thought process? \u0026ldquo;I make an effort to get out of the office at a reasonable hour twice a week. I go home and walk my dog. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the most relaxing things I do, but it often helps me to think of solutions for problems at work, even though I\u0026rsquo;m not consciously trying to solve those problems.\u0026rdquo; What outside activities complement your work interests? The interviewer is interested to see if the candidate\u0026rsquo;s personality is reflected in both work and outside activities. Your answer to this question will shed light on your personality and thus possibly on your compatibility with the job. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed tennis. In many ways it\u0026rsquo;s a game of strategy and pacing. When something isn\u0026rsquo;t working in the first set, you have to change your strategy for the second set. You also have to pace your energy in case you go to a third set, and constantly watch and read your opponent\u0026rsquo;s reactions. I\u0026rsquo;m a gutsy tennis player-I go for the big points sometimes-but I\u0026rsquo;m careful with timing. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I work, too.\u0026rdquo; If you found yourself getting burned out, what would you do to revitalize your energy? Are you disciplined enough to avoid burnout? When you\u0026rsquo;re not being productive, do you recognize it? What do you do to cope with stress? \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t allow myself to get involved in a routine to the point that I get burned out. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been the type of person who asks for new assignments so that I stay motivated and interested.\u0026rdquo; Our company believes that employees should give back time to the community. How do you feel about it? Describe a time you gave something to a community or organization as a volunteer. Do you go above and beyond what\u0026rsquo;s expected of you? Do you use your skills productively? Are you unselfish-a team player? Demonstrate how your personal interests make you productive even when you aren\u0026rsquo;t being paid. What incentives other than a paycheck inspire you? \u0026ldquo;I believe that, too. In my last job as manager I told each of my employees that they could spend one Friday afternoon a month at a charity of their choice on company time as long as they weren\u0026rsquo;t gone on the same Fridays. Ironically, productivity didn\u0026rsquo;t decrease at all; they got more done in the morning-and I guess Friday afternoons weren\u0026rsquo;t that productive to begin with. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent my afternoons with an adult reading program.\u0026rdquo; What community projects that can use your professional skills are particularly interesting to you? This interviewer wants to know if the candidate will be a good corporate citizen. The question also gives the interviewer a sense of the job seeker\u0026rsquo;s values. Try to focus your answer on productive applications of your work-related skills. Don\u0026rsquo;t get sidetracked describing a cause that doesn\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate job-related skills. Avoid discussing any charity or organization that may be considered controversial. \u0026ldquo;As a marketing person, I\u0026rsquo;ve offered free advice to our local high school for its fund-raisers, as well as to a local real-estate office whose success could help my rural community\u0026rsquo;s real-estate values.\u0026rdquo; Describe how a sport or hobby taught you a lesson in teamwork or discipline. Tell about a time you had to use teamwork to get a desired result. Tell a specific story, then explain how the same skill or lesson has been used in your work. \u0026ldquo;My football coach from high school taught me always to watch out for the other guy. If you do, he\u0026rsquo;ll cover you when you need him to. I\u0026rsquo;ve applied that principle in all my work groups, especially on the trading floor.\u0026rdquo; When you aren\u0026rsquo;t at work, do you prefer to stick to a schedule, or do you prefer to be spontaneous? Why? Be careful that, whichever answer you choose, it\u0026rsquo;s consistent with the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. For example, since accounting is a profession that requires discipline and precision, your answer should reflect your natural inclination toward agendas, schedules, and precision. However, for a sales job, you\u0026rsquo;d probably want to show that you\u0026rsquo;re prepared to wing it. This question is essentially about your job personality but is also about your compatibility with the job. \u0026ldquo;My workday is very structured because I\u0026rsquo;m generally in four or five meetings a day. On the weekends, I like to have a plan, but not necessarily a set schedule. That in itself is a relaxing change of pace for me, but I feel I\u0026rsquo;d be wasting time with no plan at all.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about an interest that you outgrew. Describe a former interest or hobby that you no longer pursue, making sure that the interest isn\u0026rsquo;t related in some way to the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. Talk about why you outgrew the interest and how it\u0026rsquo;s not compatible with your current interests. Be sure to discuss how your current interests are related to your career. \u0026ldquo;Early on, I wanted to be a research physician. Then I spent time in a chemistry lab and realized I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking forward to the next two years of lab work. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen marketing for medical equipment instead. It combines my respect for the medical profession with a job that\u0026rsquo;s more suited to my personality.\u0026rdquo; What would you do if I told you that I thought you were giving a very poor interview today? Interviewers like to ask stress questions like these to see how well you hold up under pressure. Your best bet is to stay calm and relaxed; don\u0026rsquo;t allow your confidence to be shaken. \u0026ldquo;Well the first thing I\u0026rsquo;d do is ask you if there was any specific part of the interview that you thought I might have mishandled. After that I\u0026rsquo;d think back and try to remember if there had been any faulty communication on my part. Then I\u0026rsquo;d try to review possible problems I had understanding your questions, and I\u0026rsquo;d ask for clarification if I needed it. Finally, if we had time, I\u0026rsquo;d try to respond more fully and appropriately to the problem areas you identified for me.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your most difficult work or personal experience. The interviewer will want to know how you hold up under pressure. Describe a situation, either personal or professional, that involved a great deal of conflict and challenge and placed you under an unusual amount of stress. What, specifically, were the problems, and what did you do to resolve them? \u0026ldquo;One time my coworker went through rehab for six months after a wreck, and I picked up a lot of additional work to help him out. I know he would\u0026rsquo;ve done the same for me, and it\u0026rsquo;s important for me to have that kind of trust along the members of my work group.\u0026rdquo; If this were your first annual review with our company, what would I be telling you right now? For this question you obviously want to present a positive impression. \u0026ldquo;I wish you would show up on time more,\u0026rdquo; is definitely not a good answer. Remember to focus on one or two of your key strengths based on the personal themes you\u0026rsquo;ve developed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be thanking me for a job well done and would be explaining how you look forward to continuing to see good work from me. Furthermore, I would anticipate your explaining how you really appreciated my putting in extra time on some key projects and how my creative thinking helped come up with some innovative solutions to existing problems.\u0026rdquo; Give an example of a time when you were asked to accomplish a task but weren\u0026rsquo;t given enough information. How did you resolve this problem? Although this example may seem trivial, the candidate demonstrates maturity and an ability to approach work conceptually. The interviewer will want to know that you understand that just getting the job done isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Your response should show resourcefulness and initiative. \u0026ldquo;At my last internship, my supervisor, an account executive, asked me to assemble five hundred press kits for a mailing. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure in what order the pages and press releases should go, but my supervisor had already left for a client meeting. Afraid of putting the information together in the wrong order, I managed to track down her cell phone number and called her in her car. She explained the order of the materials over the phone, and in the end I managed to prevent a mistake that would have cost hours of work and a delay in the mailing-not to mention a few headaches.\u0026rdquo; How have you handled criticism of your work? The interviewer is looking for an indication of the candidate\u0026rsquo;s accountability and professional character. Describe a specific project or work habit that caused you a problem until you faced up to it and overcame it. Alternatively, you might describe a time you responded objectively and professionally to particularly harsh or unreasonable criticism of your work. \u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to keep a good employee once who\u0026rsquo;d been in our manufacturing facility for ten years. His job description was rewritten to require computer skills. I offered to send him to night classes, but he refused the help. I had no option but to replace him. In retrospect if I\u0026rsquo;d encouraged him and other employees to acquire new training periodically, he might not have been overwhelmed by the time his position was reworked. Now I\u0026rsquo;m vigilant about encouraging my group to attend seminars and courses to enhance their job skills and to avoid becoming outdated.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a situation that frustrated you at work. This is another question designed to probe the candidate\u0026rsquo;s professional personality. The interviewer will want reassurance that you are able to hold up under pressure. Describe how you\u0026rsquo;ve remained diplomatic, objective, or professional in a difficult situation. \u0026ldquo;I was frustrated once when one of my clients, who\u0026rsquo;d insisted on a high-growth stock, called in a panic because the stock price had dropped more than twenty points in one day. I had a hard time convincing him to ride it out rather than cut his losses. This happened despite my attempts from the beginning to explain the short-term volatility of that stock.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your least-favorite manager or professor. Answering this question will be a bit like walking across a loaded minefield, so be aware! Keep in mind that the interviewer doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn about your former supervisors; he or she does want to learn about the way you speak about them. Though the interviewer may bait you to make a negative statement about your former employer, doing so can create a host of problems. Even if your claim is completely true and justified, the recruiter may conclude either that you don\u0026rsquo;t get along with other people or that you shift blame to others. The best way around this dilemma is to choose and example that\u0026rsquo;s not too negative, touch upon it briefly, then focus the rest of your answer on what you learned from the experience. \u0026ldquo;Well I\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty fortunate as far as managers go, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with my professors. In my first job out of college I worked with a manager who was pretty inaccessible. If you walked into his office to ask a question, you got the sense that you were bothering him, so we just learned to get help from each other instead. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say he was my least-favorite manager, because he was a good manager in a lot of ways, but I would have preferred that he\u0026rsquo;d made himself more available to us and given us more direction.\u0026rdquo; Who\u0026rsquo;s the toughest employer you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, and why? Again, you should avoid making negative statements about your previous employers, at all costs. Turn the question around with a positive, upbeat response, as this candidate does. \u0026ldquo;That would be Ms. Henson at Franklin Associates. She\u0026rsquo;d push people to their limits when things got busy, and she was a stickler for detail. But she was always fair, and she rewarded good, hard work. I\u0026rsquo;d call her a tough boss, but a good boss.\u0026rdquo; Time management has become a necessary factor in productivity. Give an example of a time-management skill you\u0026rsquo;ve learned and applied at work. When answering this question, describe a time-management technique you\u0026rsquo;ve applied to work that\u0026rsquo;s allowed you to save time and resources. In such areas as public relations time is precious, and the interviewer will want to see that you have an idea of how valuable your time is. Try to give an example that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve managed to increase productivity because of effective time management. \u0026ldquo;I regularly use scheduling software, which helps me effectively plan for the day, week, month, or year. It also has a to-do-list feature and an alarm option, which is helpful for meeting timely deadlines. In general, though, I\u0026rsquo;m very goal oriented and self-disciplined. I like to focus clearly on one project at a time for a set amount of hours. In the past I\u0026rsquo;ve found that this has helped me save time, which in turn has given me the opportunity to implement new procedures that have ultimately saved the department time and money.\u0026rdquo; Would you be willing to locate to another city? You may, even in some first interviews, be asked questions that seem to elicit a tremendous commitment on your behalf, such as this one. Although such questions may be unfair during an initial job interview, you may well conclude that you have nothing to gain and everything to lose with a negative response. If you\u0026rsquo;re asked such a question unexpectedly during an initial job interview, simply say something like \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s certainly a possibility\u0026rdquo; or I\u0026rsquo;m willing to consider that.\u0026quot; Later, if you receive an offer, you can find out the specific work conditions and then decide if you wish to accept the position. Remember, at the job-offer stage you have the most negotiating power, and the employer may be willing to accommodate your needs. If that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, you might wish to explain that upon reflection, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided you can\u0026rsquo;t (for instance) relocate but you\u0026rsquo;d like to be considered for other positions that might open up in the future. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to be based here, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly a possibility I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to consider.\u0026rdquo; Would you be able to work extended hours as necessary to perform the job? Your response should match closely the position you\u0026rsquo;re applying for and should reflect a realistic understanding of work and time required. Ask about seasonality of work, if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, and show a willingness to work occasional extended hours. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m accustomed to working long hours during the week. I usually work until at least six-thirty, because I get a lot done after the business office closes at five. I can make arrangements to be available on weekends, if necessary, though I do prefer to have at least twenty-four hours\u0026rsquo; notice.\u0026rdquo; Sell me this stapler. With this kind of question the interviewer will want to determine how quickly you can think on your feet, as well as your ability to communicate effectively and succinctly. Be prepared to give a thirty-second speech on the benefits and advantages of virtually any common office object, from a paper clip to a telephone, particularly if you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for a sales position. \u0026ldquo;This is a professional-quality stapler, designed to be functional as well as attractive. It will help you reduce clutter by enabling you to fasten pages together. And since papers relating to the same subject will now be attached, you\u0026rsquo;ll be more efficient and will save time searching for papers. Finally, its sleek shape and back color are coordinated to match the rest of your office furniture.\u0026rdquo; What is your biggest weakness? This is a great example of what is known as a negative question. Negative questions are a favorite among interviewers, because they\u0026rsquo;re effective for uncovering problems or weaknesses. The key to answering negative questions is to give them a positive spin. For this particular question your best bet is to admit to a weakness that isn\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic, inconsistent, or currently disruptive to your chosen professional field, and to emphasize how you\u0026rsquo;ve overcome or minimized the problem. Whatever you do, don\u0026rsquo;t answer this question with a copout like \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any,\u0026rdquo; or even worse, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any major weaknesses.\u0026rdquo; This kind of a response is likely to eliminate you from contention. \u0026ldquo;I admit to being a bit of a perfectionist. I take a great deal of pride in my work and am committed to producing the highest-quality work I can. Sometimes if I\u0026rsquo;m not careful, thought, I can go a bit overboard. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that it\u0026rsquo;s not always possible or even practical to try and perfect your work-sometimes you have to decide what\u0026rsquo;s important and ignore the rest in order to be productive. It\u0026rsquo;s a question of trade-offs. I also pay a lot of attention to pacing my work, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t get too caught up in perfecting every last detail.\u0026rdquo; Why weren\u0026rsquo;t your grades better? It\u0026rsquo;s likely that if you\u0026rsquo;ve made it to the interview stage, you fulfill the basic criteria for the position, including the education requirements. The recruiter is probably trying to judge here how well the candidate handles adversity. It\u0026rsquo;s important not to get defensive or to place blame. Instead, try to put a positive spin on the question-for example, by concentrating on what you learned and the extra effort you put in, rather than on the grades you received. \u0026ldquo;School was a wonderful experience for me. I really enjoyed learning new ideas, I studied consistently, and I was attentive in class. But I never believed in cramming before the night of an exam just to get a higher grade or staying up all night to finish a term paper. I really believe I learned just as much as many students who went for the grades.\u0026rdquo; Was there a course that you found particularly challenging? The interviewer will want to see how well you respond to difficult situations. Demonstrate that you won\u0026rsquo;t fold in the face of difficulty, and that you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put in the extra effort to meet a challenge. \u0026ldquo;Initially I was completely overwhelmed by the introductory chemistry course that I took last year. No matter how hard I studied, I seemed to be getting nowhere. I failed the first three quizzes. So I tried a new approach. Instead of just studying by myself, I asked a friend who\u0026rsquo;s a chemistry major to help me with my studies. I also began to seek help from the professor after class. And I found that more time I spent in the lab was critical. I ended up with a B-plus in the course and thought I achieved a solid understanding of the material. More than that, I learned that tackling a new field of study sometimes requires a new approach, not just hard work, and that the help of others can be crucial! Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you participate more in extracurricular activities? The interviewer may be worried that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have many outside interests, you may eventually suffer from burnout. Employers like candidates who are well rounded and have interests outside of work. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t participate in formal extracurricular activities in college, you still may want to talk about some of your interests, such as reading or exercising, that you may have a passion for running even if you weren\u0026rsquo;t on the college track team. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to give as much effort as possible to my studies. I came from a high school in a very small town, where I received a lot of A\u0026rsquo;s, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t prepare me well for college. So I studied hard. I have, however, found time to explore the city and make new friends, and I do socialize formally on the weekends.\u0026rdquo;\n[http://www.gowrikumar.com/interview/index.php]\n"},{"id":47,"href":"/posts/25_supervisor_interview_QA/","title":"25 Supervisor Interview Q\u0026A","section":"Posts","content":" What characterize a great supervisor? # A great supervisor can motivate their subordinates, they go by example, they have good observation skills, and they can utilize the strengths of the people they lead in their teams. Alternatively you can say that great supervisor maintains the highest possible productivity and motivation of the team (or of each team member), and helps the company to achieve their goals on an ongoing basis.\nWhy do you think you can become a good supervisor? # Because you have the skills and abilities a good supervisor has (mention the strengths from the first answer), because you are motivated to work hard, and because you have experience with similar jobs (if any of that is true).\nAlternatively you can go for a practical answer, narrating your experience with supervising/managing a small team. It can be a working team, a sports club, or even just a group of friends you led (in any kind of circumstances). The goal is to convince us, with the help of a practical example, that you are good at supervising people.\nHow would you assess the level of motivation of your subordinates? # Choosing the right metrics (or goals), and comparing productivity of everyone on a daily basis, is a great answer. You can also say that you would talk to your people regularly, trying to get feedback, and understand whether they are satisfied with their jobs, and motivated to work hard.\nAlternatively you can say that you would compare results of each employee, on a weekly and monthly basis, creating charts and trying to understand their current level of motivation with the help of your data. One way or another, you should demonstrate that you understand the importance of motivation in the workplace, and have a clear idea how to measure and evaluate it.\nWhat do you consider the main goals of a supervisor? # To maintain high motivation and enthusiasm in the workplace, to ensure everyone works to their full potential, and to take care of any problems that arise in the workplace, or between the workers, such as conflict, loss of motivation, and other problems.\nYou can also opt for another approach, saying that the main goal of a supervisor is to achieve the goals of the company with their team, and say that everything else is secondary, and should arise from the primary goal…\nHow do you handle conflicts with people you supervise? # You should say that you try to avoid conflicts. But if there is no way to avoid a conflict, or if you fail to avoid it, you will try to understand the perspective of the other person. Eventually you will find a solution that will be good for the entire team–and not only for you.\nYou can also say that you always try to maintain the authority of your position, since if you lost it in a conflict with one of your subordinates, other people from the team might not respect you anymore.\nYou can even elaborate on your answer, saying that you try to organize small team building events for your subordinates (playing bowling, going to the football match, playing some other games, or just drinking in a bar–definitely works in many teams :)), to strengthen a team spirit, which should lead to fewer conflict situations in the workplace.\nSpecial Tip: If you are not sure how to answer these questions in your interview, have a look at an eBook I wrote for you, the Supervisor Interview Guide. Multiple premium answers to 25 interview questions for supervisors, including difficult behavioral (scenario-based) questions, will help you stand out from your competitors, and basically say exactly what the hiring managers want to hear from you. You will find some great sample answers directly on the eBook page, so it makes sense to check it out even if you do not plan to purchase anything. Thank you!\nHow do you plan to go by an example for your subordinates? # Sticking to the rules, working hard, and even helping with manual labor (if necessary, e.g. when someone did not arrive to work, and you did not have a replacement ready) is a good answer to this question. Another way of going by example (or another approach to this interview question) is saying that you plan to actively participate in everything the team does, including the manual labor.\nYour participation will help you to understand the ins and outs of their work, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of your team members. People always respect a boss who is not afraid to take on manual labor (even if only for a few hours each week).\nHow would you motivate your team members to produce the best possible results? # Trying to create a competitive atmosphere, trying to motivate the team as a whole, organizing team building events, building good relationships with the workers, ensuring they feel good in work and receive an appropriate reward for their labor, is a great answer to this question.\nShow your interviewers that you know how to work with the laborers, and understand what motivates them to work hard every day.\nCan you define your supervisory style? # The answer to this question depends on your style of leadership. Do you prefer liberal approach, or do you prefer to maintain a strong authority in the workplace? Either one you choose, you should be able to tell the interviews why you prefer it.\nIdeally you should narrate a situation from the past, one on which you demonstrate your supervisory (leadership) style, and show the hiring managers how it helped you to achieve good results with your team. Alternatively you may say that you are ready to apply both liberal and authoritative approach, and will decide according to the conditions in the workplace, and people you will have in your team. You will simply pick the style that will suit the team you will supervise.\nHow do you imagine a typical day of a supervisor in our company? # Do not say that you imagine to walk and watch other people working, all day long :).\nYou should try to show your attention to detail, and proactive approach to work, and also your leadership. Say that you will observe the people, trying to spot the problems, and opportunities to improve the work, and consequently the results of the team. Say us that you will always be on the site, and keep an eye on your subordinates.\nYou can also say that you will devote a portion of each day to communication with your subordinates. Asking about the working conditions, and trying to get a feedback on the work they do, and also on other team members, you always try to find the areas for improvement of both working conditions and results.\nWhat do you think about starting a relationship with one of your subordinates, outside of work? Do you consider it right? # The right answer is yes and no. Good relationships outside of work can help to improve the atmosphere in a team, which nearly always leads to better results. On the other hand, you should not let your emotions to control your decisions in work, and that is hard to achieve if you become emotionally attached to one of your colleagues…\nOne way or another, we are people. You will be neither the first, nor the last boss who started to date one of their subordinates. The key is to convince us that you can make a thick line between your personal and professional life, that your relationships outside of work won’t affect the decisions you will make in your job.\nMore questions \u0026amp; sample answers to all 25 interview questions for supervisors # Why did you leave your last job? (Why do you want to leave your present job?) Describe a situation when you went above and beyond with your service (for the customer, for the colleague, for your subordinate). Can you tell us something about your working experience? What characterizes a good boss (colleague) from your point of view? Describe a situation when you were under pressure in work. Describe a time when you had to deal with an angry (upset) client or subordinate. What are your salary expectations? Describe a situation when you did not agree with the opinion of your superior, and knew that they were wrong. How did you handle the situation? Describe a situation when you faced a particularly demanding problem or challenge in your personal life. How did that affect you in your job? Describe a situation when you were unable to solve the problem on your own. Describe a time when you struggled to communicate something to your boss or subordinate. How did you manage to get your message over? Describe the biggest failure of your professional career. ….

Although talking about self-proclaimed greatness is something many people find difficult, in an interview, it’s sometimes the only way to make yourself memorable. It’s also the key difference between career progression and career stagnation.\nSo set your inhibitions to one side for the sake of this question. The interviewer has asked it entirely so they can hear about the best version of you – so unless you go completely off topic, you can’t go wrong.\nJust always make sure you prepare in advance. Otherwise, you could end up referring to a recent achievement on impulse, which may not necessarily the best one. And don’t be afraid to include dramatic effects such as results, growth, and transformation.\nRight answer: ‘My biggest success so far has to be last year’s launch of or new range of snack bars – which was the first ever health snack to sell a million units in the UK in under 12 months.

If in doubt, always follow the STAR technique.\nAnd don’t worry if things didn’t run smoothly. It wouldn’t be a difficult situation if they did. In fact, hiding away from any slip-ups will only make your example come across clichéd. Instead, use them to show how you’ve learnt to better cope in similar situations that may arise in the future.\nIt’s also a good idea to prepare your example in advance – that way you should be able to leave any emotional bias out of it.\nRight answer: ‘I think it’s important to remember that determination can sometimes cause problems – even if the person means well. For example, I once managed someone who constantly met their targets – but their team work ethic was way off. Although they appeared successful, it turned out they were taking leads from colleagues.

In other words, it’s never a one-approach-fits-all when it comes to team drive.\nTo let the interviewer know you understand this, explain that you always take the time to get to know your team members in order to understand how they work. Then, talk about how you utilise a variation of techniques based on what suits them best.\nAs always, it’s a good idea to use examples to show how you’ve succeeded at this in the past. Not only will this provide context for the strategies you use, it’ll also prove they actually work.\nRight answer: ‘My main strategies are based around recognising colleagues’ achievements, giving consistent feedback, and providing context for their work – but the ones I utilise most depends on the employee. For example, those who are most goal orientated tend to respond best to understanding the impact of their work, and colleagues that are under-performing are best motivated when given set areas to work on and improve.’\nWrong answer: ‘Blackmail seems to work…’\n"},{"id":68,"href":"/posts/Team_failure_mocking_questions/","title":"A Team Project Failure","section":"Posts","content":"Q: Tell me about a time when a team project failed.

For a project in an introductory management class, the assignment was to report on the corporate structure and financial situation of a couple of companies. The decision to be made was what companies to profile and how to present the information. Gather the necessary information. Some group members wanted to report on automakers, while others wanted to do electronics firms. We gathered information on both types of company. List all possible choices. We made lists of companies in both categories. Consider possible outcomes for each choice. We decided that a report about car companies could have a positive outcome, but one about electronics firms might be more futuristic with high-tech products such as HDTV, video game consoles, and DVD players. Check out how you feel about each of the choices. Given that this was a group project, we had to consider the feelings of all group members. Relate the choices to your values and priorities. Again, all group members weighed in on their values and priorities. From the possible alternatives, choose one. We decided that we’d do electronics companies because we could bring in products from each company and show what lies ahead. Commit yourself to your chosen decision and disregard the others. Concentrate your energies in one direction. Once we made our decision, we focused all our work on electronics firms. Take steps to turn your decision into positive action. All group members got interested in how the companies were doing. Evaluate your progress from time to time. Change your decision if necessary. We were pleased with our progress and didn’t feel a need to change our decision. We got an A on the project.

When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off.

Then I worked at SGS providing technical support to testing service. In 2004, we immigrated to Canada, I firstly worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs where I was a chemist as well as quality manager. The owner bought second-hand instruments. I had opportunity to do maintenance and troubleshooting in order to keep the instrument in good shape and save money. I also provided technical service to clients. The company is located in Northern Ontario. It was a culture shock, weather wise, community wise, language wise. The hiring manager at AECL asked me: how far away is the Walmart store? It take an hour to go to the nearest Walmart. In 2009, a job opening came up at AECL in Manitoba. They hired me in their environmental lab to support a decommissioning project. I worked there for 7 years. Due to the union working environment, I monitored the instrument performance, and provided advice. The technologists took corrective actions. Pinawa is also a remote area. 1.5 hour driving from Winnipeg, 1500 residents, no traffic lights. I enjoy living there. The problem there is there are not many jobs. When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off. Before I landed at LifeLabs, I did customer service at HR Block. self-learned R. started up my own business, and got involved in community voluntary works. After I returned to the workplace at LifeLabs in British Columbia. I spent first three months to develop two visualization applications to monitor instrument performance and data quality, one is to monitor instrument parameters, another one is to visualize data trends. I also developed checklists to identify problems when doing troubleshooting. I spent last three months at LifeLabs\nAs you can see, instrument maintenance and troubleshooting is part of my responsibilities throughout my career.

And also the other instrument, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that say if you want to use a recyclable plastic and put it into the mix up with the new polymer materials, then probably you would want it to test the different parameters like the like the intensities and strength, those are physical parameters and property you would if you want to do the recipes of the polymers, probably you have a different instrument and to measure to measure the physical properties and measure other such as the the additives to the parliament\u0026rsquo;s So, I have an experience using those instruments, when I work in the industry, and for the GC and those instruments, I had experience hands on experience in in different lab settings, I use T\u0026rsquo;s GCMS, and the LC MS and even LC triple quard. For the ICP. I use ICP-OES for the elements that metals and elements for the environmental samples. I have the knowledge of the ICP MS. And for the Raman and FTIR.

So one, one kind of scenario is when I worked in AECL, we do the analysis for the volatile organic compound and that is in the environmental samples, and we just follow the standard method. So and also tweaked a little bit based on our what we have of the instrument. So, that is very simple and quick method development that does the process is that open up open a Standard Method and follow the procedures and also there is another protocols that what is what are the parameters, we have to we have to focus on for the massive development and the massive validation, such as precision, precision accuracy, and the bias, and also robot robust, how robustness of the method. So, that very easy simple.\nand there\u0026rsquo;s another scenario so, when our work in the Lifelabs, and where that we, we analysis, different steroids profiles in a serum in the urine. And for that applications, there\u0026rsquo;s an there\u0026rsquo;s no existing well made profit method we need to follow. So, so, basically is is do the research and look up the other people\u0026rsquo;s work on the from the literatures and then sort of kind of a figure of the puzzles from here and there and then try here and there and then basically is that we have to prove the concept and the See, which, which is which is a more feasible for the clinical lab settings, because, the Lifelabs is a commercial lab, and so, they want to there is a time frame of the analysis, there is the cost involved in so, so, we have to put all different factors into our consideration how on how we devise a method and and also on the method validation part. The requirement is different from the routine, other method validation. So, that is the work flow, how I see these method development and validation.\nAnd the other perspective about about that is from the team perspective, it because in the Lifelabs that I\u0026rsquo;m quite new, I was quite new to the environment. So, the instruments, the instrument was new. And also sample prep was new to me. And so, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely need teamwork altogether. So, to do some of the, with the lots of brainstorming, and to figure out the problems I encountered, so and also get some guidance from the team lead the how, whether that\u0026rsquo;s my, my experiment makes sense or not. So there\u0026rsquo;s so many trials on the process. So there is another part of for the measure development and validation. Yeah. And then on the instrument side, and then we can we have the so many little experiment that how do we how to optimize it instrument? How do we optimize the sample preparations. Yeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s a very complete so as a very complete, complicated project. Yeah.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s there are two there\u0026rsquo;s two scenarios I all I had experience with. So I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that see your applications that what kind of what kind there was either the complicated or not so but I my understanding that Jeremiah has developed the sample preparation sample, clashes for the micro plastic and then you are going you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re about to present to the ASTM Democrat. So yeah, so you have different different methods, development and validation has different have different perspective and definitely needs. Yeah, talent, teamwork, guidance, perseverance.\nVictoria: We also kind of have two ways of doing it where, well, I guess three, because sometimes you just have a method given to you, which is lovely. But a lot of the time, we have a compound, we know in concept how to analyze it. But we have to figure out ourselves, like, using instruments and like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, like research articles, what\u0026rsquo;s the actual process for being able to quantify this material or describe this material using our instruments? And so there\u0026rsquo;s often like, a large segment of time where we\u0026rsquo;re spending, like, like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, like optimizing the method, optimizing the sample preparation, how to read it on the instrument, optimizing the instrument conditions. Yeah. And then sometimes we have experiments where we, it\u0026rsquo;s never been quantified before, like what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at, at least to the best of our knowledge, we can\u0026rsquo;t find any information on, on how to evaluate the things we want to evaluate about a material or a compound. And so we just, we just start somewhere and try to work our way through it until we can get quantifiable data.\nReview\nHigh level. three components\nDefine demand. from Workflow perspective. from teamwork perspective.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":120,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Posts","content":" Step 1.

I used gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermalgravimetric Analysis (TGA) to study characterization of polymer materials. After graduation, I developed skills and experience in chemical analysis and lab accreditation in Total and SGS in China since year 2000.\nWe immigrated to Canada in 2004. I worked at Testmark environmental labs to provide accredited analysis for environmental monitoring and drinking water quality. I developed a GC/FID method for petroleum hydrocarbon (4 fractions. F1: C6 - C10, F2: C10 - C16, F3: C16 - C34, F4: C34 - C50) in soil matrix in compliance with CCME. I was also responsible for quality management and lab operation management.\nAt the meantime, I was also a lecturer at Northern College.\nIn 2009, I joined in AECL at the lab primarily providing analysis for environmental monitoring. I developed and validated a headspace-GC/MS method to determine VOCs in aqueous matrix, and oversaw other method development by following the requirement of lab accreditation. I also developed ad-hoc analysis methods to support decommissioning projects. Meanwhile, I was responsible for quality management.\nIn 2016, I was laid off because the business decided shutting down the lab and contracting analysis. During the lay-off time, I developed skills in R and I always wanted to do something for environmental monitoring and protection with my skills in chemical analysis and R. I did a couple of projects of data exploration and visualization with a couple of lake databases.\nIn year 2020, I had an opportunity to observe Aquahacking event. It was my first time to know microplastics in water is the challenge, and observed some teams to provide solutions using data science approaches. In 2021, I also registered at North American Lake Management Society as a member, and built network at a conference.\nsensoring, IISD.\nIn 2021, I returned to the workplace, and joined in LifeLabs.

I got both bachelor degree and master degree. After schooling, I once worked at an international chemicals company in China. capital project management and a lab consultant where I traveled a lot to manufacturing plants within company and supported QC departments. I actually enjoy travelling, I read more books than I was at home, I got more things done than I was a home. Bryce told me, in this job, I donot take trips for overnight quite often, but on the road instead. When I am on the road, I listened audio books, youtube. It would be better to install a hifi module on the fleet if it is okay with the company. My wife and I donot have kids, so there is no issue from family. Then I worked at SGS providing technical support to testing service. In 2004, we immigrated to Canada, I firstly worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs where I was a chemist as well as quality manager. The owner bought second-hand instruments. I had opportunity to do maintenance and troubleshooting in order to keep the instrument in good shape and save money. I also provided technical service to clients. The company is located in Northern Ontario. It was a culture shock, weather wise, community wise, language wise. The hiring manager at AECL asked me: how far away is the Walmart store? It take an hour to go to the nearest Walmart. In 2009, a job opening came up at AECL in Manitoba. They hired me in their environmental lab to support a decommissioning project. I worked there for 7 years. Due to the union working environment, I monitored the instrument performance, and provided advice. The technologists took corrective actions. Pinawa is also a remote area. 1.5 hour driving from Winnipeg, 1500 residents, no traffic lights. I enjoy living there. The problem there is there are not many jobs. When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off. Before I landed at LifeLabs, I did customer service at HR Block. self-learned R. started up my own business, and got involved in community voluntary works. After I returned to the workplace at LifeLabs in British Columbia. I spent first three months to develop two visualization applications to monitor instrument performance and data quality, one is to monitor instrument parameters, another one is to visualize data trends.
