The stranger had lost control of his vehicle and ran it off into a ditch. The stranger asked the farmer if his horse could somehow pull the vehicle out of the ditch for him and told the farmer that the vehicle was small. The farmer said he would come, bring his horse, and take a look, but could not promise he could help if his horse might be injured in some way from attempting to pull the vehicle out of the ditch. The farmer did see that the stranger was correct and that the vehicle was small, so the farmer took a rope and fixed it so that his horse, Buddy, would be able to pull the vehicle out of the ditch. The farmer then said, \u0026ldquo;Pull, Casey, Pull,\u0026rdquo; but the horse would not budge. The farmer then said, \u0026ldquo;Pull, Bailey, Pull,\u0026rdquo; but the horse would not budge again. The farmer then said, \u0026ldquo;Pull, Mandy, Pull,\u0026rdquo; and again the horse would not move. The farmer then said, \u0026ldquo;Pull, Buddy, Pull,\u0026rdquo; and the horse pulled until the vehicle was out of the ditch. The stranger was so very grateful, but asked the farmer why he called the horse by different names? The farmer said, \u0026ldquo;Buddy is blind, and I had to make him think he had help pulling the car out of the ditch or he would not have pulled.\u0026rdquo;\nLesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t wait on others in order to accomplish something or you may always be in a ditch. Sometimes we won\u0026rsquo;t attempt to do something if we know we don\u0026rsquo;t have help.\n Reference: LetterPile\n Father and Son #  A child and his father were visiting an elderly neighbor. They were raking the neighbor\u0026rsquo;s leaves, organizing the neighbor\u0026rsquo;s garage, putting the trash out, and performing other small jobs around the neighbor\u0026rsquo;s house. The child had not really seen the elderly neighbor up close, but on this day the child was going to meet the neighbor up close for the first time. When the child met the neighbor up close he asked the neighbor how old he was, and the father was flabbergasted by his child\u0026rsquo;s question and attempted to apologize to the neighbor, but the neighbor laughed and said that was ok, the child is curious. The elderly neighbor told the child he was 92 years old. The child had a look of unbelief and asked the neighbor, \u0026ldquo;Did you start at the number one?\u0026rdquo;\nLesson: Actually, everybody starts before the number one.\n Reference: LetterPile\n Frog #  One day two frogs were hopping in and out of a watering hole and accidentally hopped in an extremely deep hole. They tried to leap out, but to no avail had no success, so they began to yell and croak until other frogs heard them and came to help. The other frogs looked over into the hole and said the hole was too deep for them to help, but both frogs kept leaping up the sides of the hole. The other frogs, leaning over the hole and waving their front legs, began to yell to the frogs to just give up and die and that there was no hope of them getting out of the hole, but both frogs kept leaping and trying to get out of the hole. They leaped for hours and one of the frogs just gave up he was so exhausted and died. The other frog in the hole kept leaping, but the other frogs, leaning over the hole, kept yelling and waving their front legs for him to stop and give up, but the frog kept leaping trying to get out of the hole. Finally the frog leaped so high that he was able to leap to the top of the hole and used his back legs to push himself up out of the hole. The other frogs said even though we told you to give up that there was no hope of you getting out of the hole you kept leaping. The frog that got out of the hole thanked the other frogs for egging him on - the other frogs didn\u0026rsquo;t know that this frog was deaf.\nLesson: Sometimes you have to turn a \u0026ldquo;deaf ear\u0026rdquo; to what others tell you is impossible.\n Reference: LetterPile\n School Bus #  A mother was seeing her 8 year-old son off to school one morning. She walked him to the bus stop where they waited patiently; the bus came and her son got on the school bus. The mother proceeded to go home so she could get ready to go to work. About 15 minutes later the doorbell rang and it was her son at the front door. She was shocked to see him since she just got him on the school bus, then she noticed the school bus with its door open, in front of her house. The mother asked her son, \u0026ldquo;What are you doing back home?\u0026rdquo; Her 8 year-old son said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m quitting school, it\u0026rsquo;s too hard, it\u0026rsquo;s too boring, and it\u0026rsquo;s too long.\u0026rdquo; The mother looked at him and said, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s life, now get back on the bus.\u0026rdquo;\nLesson: Experiences of life touch all no matter how young or how old.\n Reference: LetterPile\n Toilet #  When I was a nanny in college, I babysat for a family with a little boy and a little girl. While the boy was in school one day, I was home with his little sister, Abigail. Abigail was watching me cook in the kitchen; she was on the kitchen floor with her blanket. Abigail was cute as a button and said the funniest things, but this day proved to be a real doozie. Abigail called my name and told me that, \u0026ldquo;my toilets at my house were bigger than the toilets at her house.\u0026rdquo; I asked her why would she think that. She said, \u0026ldquo;Miss Kris, your tushy is bigger than my tushy.\u0026rdquo; Translation, because my rear end was bigger than hers, the toilets at my house have to be huge.\nLesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t have children watch you cook in the kitchen - LOL!\n Reference: LetterPile\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/","title":"Interview Experience","section":"Docs","content":"Key points:\n) Interviewers are lazy.

I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.\nThe experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable. What did we do? A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps. Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis. I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step. Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol.\nWe did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further. It was the risk.\nMy team lead and I decided to take a chance. I read through lots of literature, designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis with solvolysis, and methanolysis, set up instrument configurations, and ran experiments. To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late to work around the medical lab technologists' schedule using the automated SPE station.\nI managed to finish the project within two months. The project proved that the solvolysis approach was the best way to cleave steroid conjugates.\nThis example demonstrated:\n my commitment to the team\u0026rsquo;s success I never settle down but always seek better solutions.

He knew 'Groucho' was funnier. \u0026ldquo;I just shot an elephant in my pajamas,\u0026rdquo; goes the old Groucho Marx joke. \u0026ldquo;How he got in my pajamas I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard that one before, or something similar. For example, while viewing polling data for the 2008 presidential election on Comedy Central, Stephen Colbert deadpanned, \u0026ldquo;If I\u0026rsquo;m reading this graph correctly…I\u0026rsquo;d be very surprised.\u0026rdquo;\nZingers like these aren\u0026rsquo;t just good lines. They reveal something unusual about how the mind operates — and they show us how humor works. Simply put, the brain likes to jump the gun. We are always guessing where things are going, and we often get it wrong. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily bad. It\u0026rsquo;s why we laugh.\nIt turns out that humor is a form of mental exercise, and we benefit from it in the same way we benefit from a long run or a tough spin class. Scott Weams, author of \u0026ldquo;Ha! The Science of When_We_Laugh and Why\u0026rdquo; explains how humor increases mental stamina and flexibility.\nHumor is a form of exercise - a way of keeping the brain engaged. Mr. Colbert\u0026rsquo;s line is a fine example of this kind of mental calisthenics. If he had simply observed that polling data are hard to interpret, you would have heard crickets chirping. Instead, he misdirected his listeners, leading them to expect ponderous analysis and then bolting in the other direction to declare his own ignorance. He got a laugh as his audience\u0026rsquo;s minds caught up with him and enjoyed the experience of being fooled.\nWe benefit from taxing our brains with the mental exercise of humor, much as we benefit from the physical exercise of a long run or a tough tennis match. Comedy extends our mental stamina and improves our mental flexibility. A 1976 study by Avner Ziv of Tel Aviv University found that those who listened to a comedy album before taking a creativity test performed 20% better than those who weren\u0026rsquo;t exposed to the routine beforehand. In 1987, researchers at the University of Maryland found that watching comedy more than doubles our ability to solve brain teasers, like the so-called Duncker candle problem, which challenges people to attach a candle to a wall using only a book of matches and a box of thumbtacks. Research published in 1998 by psychologist Heather Belanger of the College of William and Mary even suggests that humor improves our ability to mentally rotate imaginary objects in our heads - a key test of spatial thinking ability.\nThe benefits of humor don\u0026rsquo;t stop with increased intelligence and creativity. Consider the \u0026ldquo;cold pressor test,\u0026rdquo; in which scientists ask subjects to submerge their hands in water cooled to just above the freezing mark.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t dangerous, but it does allow researchers to measure pain tolerance—which varies, it turns out, depending on what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing before dunking our hands. How long could you hold your hand in 35-degree water after watching 10 minutes of Bill Cosby telling jokes? The answer depends on your own pain tolerance, but I can promise that it is longer than it would be if you had instead watched a nature documentary.\nLike exercise, humor helps to prepare the mind for stressful events. A study done in 2000 by Arnold Cann, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina, had subjects watch 16 minutes of stand-up comedy before viewing \u0026ldquo;Faces of Death\u0026rdquo;—the notorious 1978 shock film depicting scene after scene of gruesome deaths. Those who watched the comedy routine before the grisly film reported significantly less psychological distress than those who watched a travel show instead. The degree to which humor can inoculate us from stress is quite amazing (though perhaps not as amazing as the fact that Dr. Cann got his experiment approved by his university\u0026rsquo;s ethical review board).\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that every sort of humor is helpful. Taking a dark, sardonic attitude toward life can be unhealthy, especially when it relies on constant self-punishment. (Rodney Dangerfield: \u0026ldquo;My wife and I were happy for 20 years. Then we met.\u0026quot;) According to Nicholas Kuiper of the University of Western Ontario, people who resort to this kind of humor experience higher rates of depression than their peers, along with higher anxiety and lower self-esteem. Enjoying a good laugh is healthy, so long as you yourself aren\u0026rsquo;t always the target.\nHaving an active sense of humor helps us to get more from life, both cognitively and emotionally. It allows us to exercise our brains regularly, looking for unexpected and pleasing connections even in the face of difficulties or hardship. The physicist Richard Feynman called this \u0026ldquo;the kick of the discovery,\u0026rdquo; claiming that the greatest joy of his life wasn\u0026rsquo;t winning the Nobel Prize - it was the pleasure of discovering new things.\nBy providing this sort of kick, humor lets our brains regularly experience the delight of discovery even if we aren\u0026rsquo;t scientists - which is fortunate, because most of are about as likely to get a doctorate in physics as we are to write for \u0026ldquo;The Colbert Report.\u0026rdquo;\nBy Scott Weams\n Reference: Westside Toastmasters\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/02-Working-Situations/04-AECL/01_difficult_people/","title":"Resolve Difficult Employee Situations","section":"AECL","content":"I once had a co-worker in our section at AECL who procrastinated testing and put team members down to make them look better. As a result, samples that they were responsible for were analyzed beyond the requested holding time. They missed the client\u0026rsquo;s expectations. The team morale went down. Some internal clients chose to subcontract analysis for a better turn-around-time service.\n[Ron described it as: the person was not up to the challenge.]\nI have developed some strategies to resolve the situation with the manager, which can be categorized into improvement, mitigation, and control.\n Setting performance objectives with the SMART approach (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). It is an effective tool because they agreed upon those objectives at the beginning of the fiscal year. I observed that they were good at keeping their reputation in public. Therefore, my manager and I held them accountable in section meetings. They accomplished work very well, and we recognized their efforts in public. The person worked better under the senior technologist\u0026rsquo;s influence. Therefore, I leveraged the peer influence to push them to get started. Occasionally the senior technologist had to work with them side-by-side. They accomplished works well, but it is not sustainable. Once the senior technologist retired, their productivity suffered. I realized that they were good at administrative work. As a result, the manager and I reduced their analysis responsibilities to minimize the operation\u0026rsquo;s damage and assigned more administrative work. In addition, we asked them to join the site safety committee and other administrative-related work. I applied the idea of \u0026ldquo;the emotional bank account\u0026rdquo; from the book \u0026ldquo;The 7 habits of Highly Effective People\u0026rdquo; to them. We maintained a positive work relationship, even though I had to deal with conflicts with them. With the advice of the Employee Assistance Program at Morneau Shepell, I was able to identify the root cause of their behaviour. I shared it with the manager, but we did not come up with better solutions for this one.  Looking back, I wish I could have been trained earlier in business psychology at AECL before handling the difficult employee situation. Here is an example: I later read a book, \u0026ldquo;The Platinum Rule,\u0026rdquo; later on. The principle is \u0026ldquo;Do unto others as they would like done unto them.\u0026rdquo; Then the author developed strategies to work with persons in four categories, Directors, Socializers, Relaters, and Thinkers. I can relate that person to Socializer, and I learnt that I followed some of the guidelines in the book, but I missed others. I would have more strategies to help them out. I applied this principle at LifeLabs. I could identify different personal styles and manage to work with them better.\nI will continue to learn business psychology in the new job position to ensure the smooth and successful running of the laboratory.\n link\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/03-Soft-Skills/06-Lead-in-Rowing/Rowing_leadership_lesson/","title":"A Powerful Leadership Lesson From the Sport of Rowing","section":"Lead in Rowing","content":"A Powerful Leadership Lesson From the Sport of Rowing #  In this team sport, the advantage of \u0026lsquo;free speed\u0026rsquo; can teach small-business owners a lot about sustained success.\nBY LARRY ROBERTSON, FOUNDER, LIGHTHOUSE CONSULTING\nLeading an entrepreneurial venture is hard, which is precisely why you\u0026rsquo;re always on the lookout for insight that gives you an edge. And there is plenty to be found in the sport of rowing.\nSome lessons are familiar, like teamwork. In rowing, you can\u0026rsquo;t move an eight-person shell if you don\u0026rsquo;t do it together. Then there\u0026rsquo;s adaptability, where, just as in business, no two days or even hours on the water are alike. Wind, water, equipment, and competition can never be fully predicted, so being able to adapt at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice is vital. But there\u0026rsquo;s another lesson that gives an edge in business as it does in rowing: free speed.\nTrue free speed in rowing would be having a lighter boat, which requires less energy to move, freeing up energy to gain speed - a real advantage. In contrast, false free speed is the rowers' joke about everyone in the boat needing a haircut, as if the loss of a few grams of hair could provide a similar competitive advantage. The difference seems clear, but it\u0026rsquo;s remarkable how hard-working rowers, just like busy entrepreneurs, allow the lines between true advantage and wishful thinking to blur.\nHere are three ways to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re gaining the advantage of free speed in your business\u0026ndash;and not just fooling yourself.\nShare your knowledge, don\u0026rsquo;t hoard it\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a fact: the more you know, the better equipped you are to achieve, adapt, innovate, and excel in business. If that\u0026rsquo;s what you want, you can\u0026rsquo;t hoard knowledge. Yet many entrepreneurs do. The rationale they hawk is one of control. In truth, hoarding knowledge is wishful thinking. Rather than speeding you up, inevitably it slows you and your team down. And think about it\u0026ndash;if you can\u0026rsquo;t trust your team with the knowledge they need to contribute to your collective success, then far bigger problems are looming on your horizon. Shared knowledge is power, and it\u0026rsquo;s the power you need to speed up the entrepreneurial success you seek.\nCreate a shared purpose, and practice it daily\nWhile powerful, knowledge is at best misguided speed if those you share it with aren\u0026rsquo;t all rowing in the same direction with a shared sense of purpose. Believing you can state the mission and just move on is effectively the business equivalent of choosing to row in circles, never actually achieving the bigger goals of ongoing success and growth. In contrast, having a shared sense of why you do what you do and linking it to your decisions and actions every single day builds the habit of advantage. The key here is applying shared purpose as a daily filter\u0026ndash;something few entrepreneurial teams do, and the main reason why they never tap the power of shared purpose. By working shared purpose into every thought and action in your business, it become a fine-tuning tool that helps you gain advantage. Doing so is simple, cumulatively powerful, and, best of all, free.\nEmpower your team to lead The greatest example of entrepreneurs mistaking wishful thinking for free speed is their reticence to allow leadership to be shared. Not sharing leadership is the equivalent of sharing knowledge and purpose, and then telling those you share it with not to act. Talk about weighing a business down.\nAt the end of the day - and every day - entrepreneurial success is a team sport. And you can achieve that success faster, and more often, when everyone is empowered to grab an oar and contribute.\nMy Leadership Lesson Take-away #  exactly same motion, good timing.\n Coaching. Observation and coaching approach. Provide constructive feedback. encouragement. Build culture. spirit of group. administrative things.  \r\rRowing Terms #  Seating: Seating positions in a racing shell are generally numbered from the bow to the stern in English-speaking countries, unlike many non-English-speaking countries which count from the Stroke forward. Generally the forwardmost rower is called the \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo; and the aftmost rower the \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;, regardless of the number of rowers in the boat, with all other seats simply being numbered. So for instance the crew of an eight (with coxswain) would number off from the bow: \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Two\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Three\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Four\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Five\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Six\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Seven\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;, whereas a four (with or without coxswain) or a quad would number off: \u0026ldquo;Bow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Two\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Three\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stroke\u0026rdquo;.\nBow (bow seat, person in charge): the rower closest to the front.\nStroke (Seat): The rower closest to the stern of the boat, responsible for the stroke rate and rhythm.\nStarboard (US): the right or starboard side of the boat\nPort (US): the left side of the boat.\nStern: The rear section of a shell.\nCommands #  \u0026ldquo;Easy\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;ease up\u0026rdquo;)(USA): To stop rowing hard.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold Water\u0026rdquo;(USA): Emergency stop, also used after the command way enough. It instructs the rowers to square their blades in the water to stop the boat.\n\u0026ldquo;Let it/her run\u0026rdquo;: To stop rowing after a given piece of on the water rowing length, but to put the handles of the oars either to the gunwales or out in front of the rower, in such a manner that the oar paddles are parallel to the water yet not touching it. This allows the boat to glide for a distance leaving no paddle wake in the water. Similar, but not exactly the same is the command \u0026ldquo;Gunnel\u0026rdquo;, where rowers push the oars until the handle touches the boat\u0026rsquo;s gunwale.\n\u0026ldquo;Power 10\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;10 firm\u0026rdquo; ): The command to take 10 strokes at more than full pressure. Used for passing and gaining water in a race. (sometimes \u0026ldquo;Power 5\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Power 20\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Power 30\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Hard on port/starboard\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;port/starboard pressure\u0026rdquo;): The rowers on that side of the boat must row harder (and the opposite side must row slightly easier) in order to facilitate a sharper turn.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/03-Gordon-Foundation/01-Interview-Prep/","title":"Gordon Foundation","section":"Gordon Foundation","content":"I sent my application on May 26th with a project report.

客户：““我们这次大概想要一个这样的东西，……（此处略于50字），目前想法还不成熟，你们还有什么问题吗？”\n  印度员工：“好的，我们回头列一些问题，再跟你们进行第二轮沟通。 ”\n 回到公司，他们不慌不忙地开始讨论，既不加班，也不占用午餐时间，过了两天，列出了整整24个小问题。\n**和客户的第二轮沟通，他们会用一天的时间，把这24个问题一个一个地讨论完。**如果冒出了一批新问题，就再进行新一轮会面，直到把所有问题全部沟通得一清二楚，他们才开始……干活？\nNoNoNo，他们还要把所有沟通结果整理成一个文档，再跟客户开一次会，把自己的理解再跟客户确认一遍，去纠正双方在理解上的分歧。\n最后，他们还会把这些沟通结果整理成详细的文档，发给客户，再抄送所有项目组的成员，确保大家的理解都是一致的，才开始正式干活。\n这两种工作方式的结果就是：中国员工做出来的东西有想法，有新意，但不到最后关头，你根本不知道自己会得到什么； 印度员工的工作平庸，刚刚好用，一点也不肯浪费自己的工作，但却刚好是你想要的。\n如果你是老板，你喜欢用那一种员工？\n3/5、崇尚实干少说的中国文化\n轮聪明，印度人绝对比不过中国人。编程挑战网站HackerRank分析了递交的140万份编程挑战代码，结果显示中国程序员的得分最高，统治了数学、函数编程和数据结构领域，远远超过人数更多的印度程序员。\n但印裔国际CEO的数量之多，也是不争的事实。美国的500强企业的75位少数族裔CEO中，10位是印度裔；谷歌董事会的13人中，4位是印度裔；高科技公司里7%的CEO也都来自印度，而且比例还在升高。\n很多管理学家认为，印度人的成功，很大程度上来自于他们严谨的沟通能力。\n但在有海外工作经验的中国员工印象中，印度裔CEO普遍能说会道，拍马屁不干实事。\n一个事实，两种观点，这其实是一个“沟通文化”的差异。\n中国人去了印度，总觉得印度人都是奇葩，毫无时间效率的概念；印度人接触了中国人后都认为，中国人太过变态，做什么事情都是急吼吼地先干起来再说。\n中国的时间观念强，所以觉得沟通太浪费时间；印度人自我感觉太好，不愿意白费功夫，宁可把话先说清楚。\n事实上。在中国的文化传统中，我们不喜欢那些能说会道的人，更崇尚实干精神，所谓“满瓶不动半瓶摇”。\n中国历史上的聪明人，都不喜欢沟通，反而爱故弄玄虚。诸葛亮有了作战计划，从来不跟大家解释，每回都要摆一桌酒席，反正大家都没心思吃，全到他一个人的肚子里了。\n诸葛亮式的老板，计划的所有细节都在他一个人的脑子里，做他的下属，需求都是明确有，只需要听命令，甲干啥，乙干啥，最后大家的工作一拼，刚好完成任务。\n不习惯沟通，造成了两个问题，一部分人“表达能力弱”，无法把对客户的理解表达成准确的语言，只能先“做出来”再说。\n而另一部分“沟通达人”走上另一个极端，他们平常说的“沟通一下”，更多是强调诱导、说服，甚至是诡辩，而不是理解对方的想法。\n教育也是一个原因。我们的学校教育总是以标准答案为核心，很少让学生们针对问题，去提出自己问题，长此以往就不会提问题了。一旦面对不确定的需求，往往无所适从。\n中国社会的商业信任度低也是一个原因。因为乙方常常用专业来欺骗甲方，甲方在和乙方的沟通中，总是半信半疑，相信眼见为实，喜欢让乙方多做几次给自己挑选的余地。\n不得不说，也许是中国人既聪明又勤快，聪明到觉得别人无法理解自己，勤快到觉得沟通是一种浪费时间，宁愿浪费自己的才华，多返几次工，也不愿多费口舌。\n因为彪悍的人生不需要解释啊。\n4/5、机会太多，懒得沟通\n很多人可能不服气，你说印度人管理能力强，为什么印度本土厉害的大企业没有中国多呢？\n因为沟通只是管理的一部分，管理还包括战略和执行效率，不同的市场阶段，管理的重点是不同的。\n在一个高速发展的蓝海市场，执行效率最重要，如果一定要把需求搞得一清二楚再动手，等别人先做出来了，那你就白干了。因此只要需求大致靠谱，大可以撸起袖子先干起来。\n大的互联网企业甚至连内部都在竞争。同一个项目，往往有不同的小组在做，之间没有任何沟通。对于企业而言，宁可浪费财力物力人力，也不可浪费时间，市场太大了，只要有一个组做成功，别的组的投入总能收回来。\n但在一个成熟的市场，处处是红海，人力成本高昂，市场变化慢，时间反而不值钱，就要精细化管理，充分沟通需求，否则，“高效率”带来的必是高浪费。\n所以印度人的“沟通能力”，在本土市场就是浪费时间，但到了美国，面对高素质的西方员工和成熟的市场，就会如鱼得水。\n另一方面，中国制造的强项是标准化产品，可以通过产品的不断升级，一步步改善客户体验；但广告公司服务客户，下属服务老板，显然都属于定制化的专业服务，需要大量的前期沟通，最后才能一锤定音。\n在一个成熟的、规范的、缺乏弹性的竞争环境中，那些搞不清客户需求的“先干起来”，显然既浪费了自己的精力，又浪费了对方的时间。\n那么，我们应该如何挖掘客户或老板潜在的需求呢？\n5/5、需求沟通的三个阶段\n需求沟通通常包括三个阶段：激发潜在需求、明确核心需求、形成行动框架。\n在汽车没有诞生之前，你问客户想要什么，他一会回答，想要一辆更快的马车。\n所谓“潜在的需求”，不是客户说“我要XXX”，而是那些让他们夜不能寐的恐惧、如鲠在喉的痛苦、甚至是那些“嘴上说不要，身体却很诚实”的内心渴望。\n这就是**“激发潜在需求”的阶段**，它只能通过貌似效率低下的交流来实现，这同时也是给对方一个明显的信号：在搞清楚你到底想要什么之前，我是绝对不会动手的。\n在**“明确核心需求”阶段**，重要的是确保双方对文字的理解都是一致的。中文是一种多义的语言，这个阶段必须消除每一个可能产生歧义的句子。\n乙方和员工们在沟通中，常常故意留下一些模糊地带，以方便自己的执行，这就是甲方和老板们深恶痛绝的**“专业陷阱”**，殊不知这点小聪明会让你失去信任。还不如开诚布公地请客户和老板理解，执行过程中必要的弹性空间。\n最后是**“形成行动框架”阶段**，这个阶段最重要的是保证每一个参与的成员都能明白，而不仅仅是负责沟通的人。\n一开始，有些人可能觉得你太“唐僧”。别在意，只要你最终能证明自己是一个靠谱的人，人家总会尊重你的工作习惯的。\n广告圈有一句名言：“最好的提案，不是现场把客户给震了，而是走走过场。“\n不让你让玩猫腻，而是说要在前期沟通中，帮助对方找到真实需求，商量出双方都能接受方案，这么一来，老板和客户们还有个屁意见啊？\n

What did you do to resolve the situation? Why did you select these actions? What was the final outcome? Looking back, what would you have done differently? Why? (Maximum 500 words.)\n I once had a co-worker in our section at AECL who procrastinated testing and put team members down to make them look better. As a result, samples that they were responsible for were analyzed beyond the requested holding time. They missed the client\u0026rsquo;s expectations. The team morale went down. Some internal clients chose to subcontract analysis for a better turn-around-time service.\nI have developed some strategies to resolve the situation with the manager, which can be categorized into improvement, mitigation, and control.\n Setting performance objectives with the SMART approach (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). It is an effective tool because they agreed upon those objectives at the beginning of the fiscal year. I observed that they were good at keeping their reputation in public. Therefore, my manager and I held them accountable in section meetings. They accomplished work very well, and we recognized their efforts in public. The person worked better under the senior technologist\u0026rsquo;s influence. Therefore, I leveraged the peer influence to push them to get started. Occasionally the senior technologist had to work with them side-by-side. They accomplished works well, but it is not sustainable. Once the senior technologist retired, their productivity suffered. I realized that they were good at administrative work. As a result, the manager and I reduced their analysis responsibilities to minimize the operation\u0026rsquo;s damage and assigned more administrative work. In addition, we asked them to join the site safety committee and other administrative-related work. I applied the idea of \u0026ldquo;the emotional bank account\u0026rdquo; from the book \u0026ldquo;The 7 habits of Highly Effective People\u0026rdquo; to them. We maintained a positive work relationship, even though I had to deal with conflicts with them. With the advice of the Employee Assistance Program at Morneau Shepell, I was able to identify the root cause of their behaviour. I shared it with the manager, but we did not come up with better solutions for this one.  Looking back, I wish I could have been trained earlier in business psychology at AECL before handling the difficult employee situation. Here is an example: I later read a book, \u0026ldquo;The Platinum Rule,\u0026rdquo; later on. The principle is \u0026ldquo;Do unto others as they would like done unto them.\u0026rdquo; Then the author developed strategies to work with persons in four categories, Directors, Socializers, Relaters, and Thinkers. I can relate that person to Socializer, and I learnt that I followed some of the guidelines in the book, but I missed others. I would have more strategies to help them out. I applied this principle at LifeLabs. I could identify different personal styles and manage to work with them better.\nI will continue to learn business psychology in the new job position to ensure the smooth and successful running of the laboratory.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/03-Gordon-Foundation/01-Interview-Prep/Know_your_business_Gordon_prep/","title":"What do you know about Our Business?","section":"Gordon Foundation","content":"Gordon Foundation is a charitable organization.

And you have stopped giving your time to things that do not matter to you. So integrity is you know, who you are. openness. Other people know who you are. Other people know why you\u0026rsquo;re motivated, do things you do other people understand when and where they can count on you. So integrity is about you and understanding who you are. Openness is about how you let others know this fundamental who that is in you. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got integrity, you know who you are. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got openness, other people know who you are, it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you trustworthy. All the good intent in the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the skills to deliver on what matters, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have the discipline. To both hold yourself and hold others accountable. And to be fair with others, but also know where the limits are and be able to be assertive when others are overstepping the bounds or underperforming.\nAnd these four aspects are necessary if you are to be someone worthy of trust, integrity, openness, competence, and results. And I\u0026rsquo;ll stick a link down below to some Luis Suarez material on trustworthy but this is such a fundamental aspects Jim Collins is the number one most important thing in business, selecting, motivating, and putting the right people in the right seats.\nResults: provide deliverables on time.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/03-Soft-Skills/05-Writing/Write_a_sparkling_sentence/","title":"Write a Sparkling Sentence","section":"Writing","content":"Write better sentences #    Sigh*  You know it’s time to knuckle down.\nAnd finally write those web pages.\nBut you struggle to get started.\nIs your writing good enough? Can you persuade readers to contact you? And buy from you? Can you make your content easy to read, engaging, and inspirational?\nGood writing isn’t as hard as it seems.\nLet’s start at the beginning, shall we?\nWhat makes a sentence good? #  Picture yourself home alone. It’s Friday night.\nYou treat yourself to a glass of red Rioja Reserva, and you sit down in your favorite sofa to read the book you received from a friend. At last.\nYour phone rings. But you let it ring. The neighbor’s dogs are barking, but for once you don’t hear them.\nWhen you’re so engrossed in your book, you read complicated sentences with ease.\nA sentence of 63 words? You gobble it up:\n If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. ~ J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye\n Now imagine yourself at your desk, starting to read the first out of more than one hundred unread emails in your inbox. How much time do you allocate to each email?\nYou might read a short email word by word. But when it’s long? You glance. You skim. You try to extract its purpose as quickly as you can.\nMost online readers are task-oriented (Empty that inbox! or Get that flight booked!). They’re not snuggled up in their favorite sofa, giving your words all their attention. They’re in fast mode. They’re itching to get a task done, so they can move on.\nWant to improve your business writing skills?

The biggest problem in business writing is generic gobbledygook. To avoid wishy-washiness, add specific facts to your sentences.\n  Focus on your reader. Good marketing copy doesn’t feel like a sleazy sales pitch. It’s a cozy conversation with your reader.\n  Make your readers feel something. Scrap weak words. Instead, add emotion or paint a picture. Make your content more dramatic with action sentences.\n  Keep your average sentence length at a maximum of 14 words. A lower average would be better. The examples below have on average 9 words per sentence, making them easy to read.\n  Be concise. Eliminate each redundant word.\nConciseness isn’t about the length of a sentence. A long sentence can be concise when each word is relevant and adds meaning.\n  Finding these 5 keys a little vague and abstract?\nLet’s analyze a few examples …\n5 examples of good sentences in business writing #  Example 1: a stylus for iPad #   Our adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page. Rest your hand on the screen, write from any angle. No calibration or setup. You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.\n 4 sentences. 36 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\n  This paragraph is clearly focused on the reader, listing various benefits of adaptive palm rejection.\n  The benefits are ranked using the So what? method:\nThe adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page. So what? You can rest your hand on the screen and write from any angle. So what? You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.\n  The benefits show a superb mix of problems you avoid—no mistaking your hand for your stylus, no calibration, no setup—and positive benefits—write from any angle, forget you’re creating on a tablet.\n  Example 2: iPad Air #   Not just a thinner display. A better display.\nThe displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal reﬂectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid.\n 61 words. 7 sentences.\nWhy these sentences are good:\n The two opening lines, and the question The result? might all be crossed out by your high school teacher because they’re broken. But these broken sentences add a dynamic rhythm to Apple’s writing. Read the paragraph aloud and you’ll hear what I mean. Apple copywriters are the masters of broken sentences. The technical explanation is specific—three simple sentences explain why iPad Air 2 is thinner (because it fuses three layers into one), and why this means the display is better, too (no gaps so no internal reflectance). After the technical explanation, the closing line returns back to the reader by explaining what it means for the reader to have a better display. This sentence harnesses the power of three—highlighting three benefits in a row (colors, contrast, and images).  Example 3: A curry (ready-made meal) #   You’re in Vietnam. You’ve whizzed around Hanoi in a rickshaw. You’ve walked around admiring the rice fields and the meandering waterways of the Mekong Delta. You’ve smiled and nodded enthusiastically at some happy locals. And right now you’re settling down for a delicious, flavoursome meal of udon noodles, veg, tasty sauce and spices. Enjoy (chopsticks optional).\n 6 sentences. 56 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\n The first sentence is sublimely short, making it easy for your reader to start reading the next sentence.  The text paints a clear picture by using vivid imagery—rickshaw, meandering waterways, Mekong delta. The text is action-focused, adding drama—you’ve whizzed, you’ve walked, you’ve smiled and nodded. Do you find yourself smiling, when your read this, too? This vivid description elevates eating curry to an exotic experience full of joy.  Example 4: Gifts for guys #   We say ‘no’ to ugly neckties, cologne samplers and executive trinkets. We don’t save wrapping paper, we don’t do ribbons.\nWe ship bragworthy gifts for guys.\n 3 sentences. 26 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\n How specific can you get? Man Crates doesn’t tell us they dislike boring gifts for men. They tell us specifically what type of gifts they don’t like. Pretty clear, isn’t it? The sentence We ship bragworthy gifts for guys is more persuasive after the explanation of what they don’t do. Man Crates speaks strongly to their target audience. Note, for instance, the word bragworthy—according to some dictionaries it’s not even a word.  Example 5: Web hosting #   Is your website up? More importantly, are search engines and subscribers receiving your content? If you are a content publisher, you need to know. But unless you are actually on the site, how do you know?\n 4 sentences. 36 words.\nWhy these sentences are good:\n Want to speak strongly to your reader? Then enter the conversation already going on in your reader’s mind. That’s exactly what these questions do. Did you find yourself quietly nodding yes, while reading these questions? When you start nodding yes, you’re more likely to say yes to their offer of web hosting, too. This is what psychologists call the consistency principle. Once we’re in the mood for saying yes, we keep saying yes. In my free snackable course I explain this power of the subtle nod.  Good writing starts with an appreciation of sentences #  I like this anecdote that Annie Dillard shares in her book The Writing Life:\n A well-known writer got collared by a university student who asked, “Do you think I could be a writer?”\n“Well,” the writer said, “I don’t know…. Do you like sentences?”\nThe writer could see the student’s amazement. Sentences? Do I like sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, “I liked the smell of the paint.”\n The truth about writing a good sentence #   Writing for business isn’t like academic writing.\nDon’t show off your intelligence. Don’t brag about your command of words originating from Greek and Latin. Don’t impress your readers with undulating sentences.\nYour content isn’t about you and your business.\nYour content is about your readers.\nConnect with his wishes, dreams, and secret desires.\nBe engaging. Be enchanting. Be good.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/11-CGC-QA-2016/Interview/01_concise_procedure/","title":"Concise Procedure","section":"Interview","content":"Question 2: Identify an accident/incident in your community that your local newspaper, radio, news, etc. reported within the last two or three months that involved either personal harm or property damage.\n•\tWrite a Report on this accident/incident and develop a procedure on how to avoid this happening again.\n•\tPlease provide an electronic copy of the news article or other information e.g. Weblink (URL) that was used related to this specific report and submit as part of your exam question answers.\n Response:\nReport:\nOne adult and one minor are facing multiple charges in connection with a number of break-ins in the Beausejour area. Amber Hope Mann, 18, arrested on Aug. 16th, appeared in Beausejour court on Aug. 30th. She was released on $500 bail and is scheduled to reappear in Beausejour court on Sep. 20th. A 15-year-old female is also charged. The minor cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.\nThey were suspected that they involved the incidents happened between July 21st and Aug. 16th. According to the RCMP, the break-ins to vehicles were reported. A credit card was allegedly stolen from one of the vehicles. The suspects attempted to use the credit cards. A break, enter and theft at the First Street Medical Clinic on Aug. 9th was also reported. A computer was stolen.

The signages of surveillance cameras shall be posted in the public area. The camera presence would help to stop teenagers from break-ins because they would know they are watching.\nA preventive plan starts with identification of the problem(s). The RCMP is responsible for conducting root cause analysis. The vehicle owners, the Medical Clinic owner, the neighborhood, the suspects, and the suspect families will be involved in the investigation. The RCMP would need to open up similar cases from the tracking system when possible for the root causes and the preventive actions. The following questions would assist to identify the problem(s).\n•\tWhat should the significant level of these incidents be?\n•\tHow did the two teenagers break in the vehicles? Were the vehicles locked?\n•\tHow did the two teenagers break in and enter the Medical Clinic?\n•\tWhat did they do for?\n•\tWere the two teenagers involved in drugs?\n•\tWhat do behaviors and characters of the two teenagers look like?\n•\tWhat challenges are the suspect families facing?\n•\tIs there Neighborhood Watch program in place? If so, the RCMP evaluates the performance.\nIt is the residents’ expectation that they do not want to see these two teenagers violate the laws, and they do not want to see other teenagers break the laws. The preventive plan would not be successful without the community commitment. The RCMP will take the lead of the plan. A RCMP staff will be assigned to be responsible for identifying, tracking and implementing improvements to this procedure. The RCMP staff will work with schools, law enforcement agencies, public health agencies, community library, workplaces, religious institutions, child protective agencies, volunteers, and others in the community to develop the plan. Some suggestions are mentorship, counseling, job skill training, internships, entrepreneurship opportunities, guidance, organized recreation, tutoring programs, part-time work, and volunteer opportunities. After the discussion with the community, the RCMP staff will come up with a goal using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely) approach and associated plan/actions. The RCMP staff will then bring the goal and the plan to the community and get feedback. The goal and the plan will be revised if necessary.\nEach organization and volunteer of the community executes the plan. The RCMP staff monitors the process through a communication mechanism on a regular basis. The RCMP staff will also adjust the plan along the process based on their feedback. At the mid-point of the plan, the RCMP will meet all organizations and volunteers reviewing the performance of the plan. At the end point of the plan, all objectives of the goal should be achieved. A follow-up plan shall be taken to address the remaining issues.\nThe RCMP will take a pro-active approach in developing a more creative and innovative mechanism that builds on lesson-learned and experience gained on this preventive action and other similar preventive actions to reduce teenager crimes.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/10-CGC-Chemist-2016/Interview/01_Prioritize_tasks/","title":"Prioritize Work Tasks","section":"Interview","content":"Q9\tDescribe the criteria you use to prioritize your work tasks.

The branch set clear expectations about turn-around-time of analysis, the priority of analysis from different clients, the requirements of accreditation and regulation. I prioritize my tasks according to these expectations. I have a list of performances every year.

If it\u0026rsquo;s a shot in the dark, take a moment to see where in the framework it fits the best, if you can. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, just use your best judgment. The next two questions will help you with that.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste your time fighting petty battles. When you do that, then people will see you as someone who is a bully. If you want to clear a room, or at least take all the sunshine out of it when you approach, be sure to fight over the little things.\nIt takes wisdom and experience to know when to fight and when to lay down your weapons. Sure, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll be angry. Just don\u0026rsquo;t let it flare so much that it takes over your thinking. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve answered this question, ask yourself this one:\n“Will doing this someone else\u0026rsquo;s way be wrong?” #  It takes a strong leader to admit that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be right all the time.\nIt also means you\u0026rsquo;re smart enough to know that you\u0026rsquo;re not perfect.\nAll anyone can do is the best of which they\u0026rsquo;re capable.\nWith that in mind, can you use someone else\u0026rsquo;s idea to get to your desired outcome? Of course, you can.\nA wise person once said, “Ideas don\u0026rsquo;t care who has them.” Everyone\u0026rsquo;s brain is creative, whether or not she thinks it is. We all have ideas. Some are good. Others, not so good. When you have a group discussion, you\u0026rsquo;ll have all sorts of ideas on the table. Usually, at least one of you will have the foresight to pick out the best idea from the lot.\nSo, don\u0026rsquo;t rely on the limits of your own experience while you\u0026rsquo;re working out a plan.\nBut as a leader, ultimately the final decision is yours. You can weigh that decision with the third question, which is …\n“Will taking this risk be worth it?” #  You can\u0026rsquo;t escape risk. Nothing in life it totally safe and predictable. You can\u0026rsquo;t know how everything will turn out.\nSo, take a moment to think through the consequences of your choice. What do you know? What do you need to learn? What is the worst that could happen if you go ahead?\nAnswer those questions and you\u0026rsquo;ll have the answer to this question.\nAnd at the very least, when you do fight, at least you can do it in a civil manner. You can listen. You can debate. And you\u0026rsquo;ll have a foundation to guide you through the whole process.\nReference:\nMcKinley, Frank.

But they are nothing without people. Even if you are an Internet Entrepreneur, and everything you do is automated, you need people to buy your stuff to keep it going.\nThe biggest capital you have isn\u0026rsquo;t the number of dollars you have in the bank.

That\u0026rsquo;s the way people see you.\nThree ways you can handle conflict: prevention, discovery, and hitting it head on.\nAn Ounce of Prevention #  As a leader, you\u0026rsquo;re a lot like a fireman.\nOne aspect of a fireman\u0026rsquo;s job is fire prevention.\nYou \u0026lt;prevent fires by keeping gasoline away from lit matches.\nRules and vision statements provide an excellent way to prevent conflicts. They do this by writing scripts that people use to define their activities. If the script is good, there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any misunderstanding that can lead to a fight.\nWe wear masks of civility around others rather than speak everything that is in our minds. For example, if you thought your coworker\u0026rsquo;s dress was absolutely ghastly, would you tell her if it really didn\u0026rsquo;t matter in the grand scheme of things?\nOf course, there is a time when honesty is called for. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be brutally delivered if a softer hit will do the job. The measuring rod for this is what effect something has on the group as a whole, not just you.\nSo, make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t put flammable materials together if you want to prevent conflicts.\nDiscovery - A Prescription for Peace #  There\u0026rsquo;s always something hiding in the bushes that can catch fire.\nDo your best to discover what they are so you can address them before they turn into full-scale conflicts.\nPeople forget the organizational mission, too. Most of us forget every thought about work when the five o\u0026rsquo;clock whistle blows. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;ve asked anyone, \u0026ldquo;Are you ready for the weekend?\u0026rdquo; the answer is always some form of \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; After that, we have to psyche ourselves up for another workday. As a leader, it\u0026rsquo;s your job to periodically, even daily, remind your team what game they\u0026rsquo;re playing - and why.\nHitting Conflict Head On #  So don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Be strong and courageous. Fight if you must, but do all you can to keep the bleeding to a minimum.\nAlso, remember why you\u0026rsquo;re fighting. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a vision to guide you, you may not have the resolve to see it through. And you might make a choice that will make the conflict worse.\nReference:\nMcKinley, Frank.

If you\u0026rsquo;re nervous, your voice will reveal even the slightest quiver and hesitation. And if you\u0026rsquo;re disinterested, it will take away from the melody you normally have when you\u0026rsquo;re feeling great.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the solution?\nActing classes?\nNo.\nShould you just fire the person due to irreconcilable differences?\nThat might be admissible in court if you\u0026rsquo;re getting a divorce, but not in the workplace.\nThe Power of Forgetting\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s really good to forget.\nThe best thing you can do when you have to work with someone who annoys the snot out of you is to forget that you can\u0026rsquo;t stand them.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll bet you\u0026rsquo;re standing there thinking, “Yeah, like I can do that.”\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t, then you\u0026rsquo;re dead in the water.\nThree Reasons Why You Should Forget You Can\u0026rsquo;t Stand That Annoying Coworker Here are some things to remember when dealing with someone who makes your life difficult.\n1. As people, they have value.\nIf you believe life is precious, you have to agree that people—all people—have value.\nNow what about vicious criminals whose sole purpose in life is to maim and kill? Don\u0026rsquo;t they deserve to die?\nSure.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s think about this. When someone\u0026rsquo;s behavior is reprehensible to the point of killing others, death is a reasonable punishment. But you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that in our court system, that is the last resort. Why? Because we as a society value life. We want to believe in second chances. We want to give others every opportunity to make things right.\nAnd, if you were to be convicted of a murder you didn\u0026rsquo;t commit, would you want to be quickly condemned to death?\nSure, she may have some annoying habits like filing her nails during meetings. Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s loud enough to hear across the building when she talks. But if she has a brain, she has the potential for good ideas. If she has friends, then she must be doing something right.\nAnd if she was hired, someone (maybe even you) thought she could do the job. So, give her respect as a fellow human being.\n2. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s opinion matters.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t always agree with other members of your team.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not always right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to have debate on issues. For example, you can benefit from others' experience even when you both do the same thing. If she\u0026rsquo;s had more success, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like to know how she does it?\nEveryone has ideas. Since we\u0026rsquo;re not all the same, it\u0026rsquo;s good to use each other to get better. If you like basketball, will you be your best if you only practice shooting hoops by yourself?\nNo, you need competition to prove how good you can be.\nLet your coworkers make you sharper.\nThen do the same for them.\n3. Remember that when you don\u0026rsquo;t like a suggestion someone makes, she may be right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tempting to let your opinion of someone color your perception of how good her ideas can be.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like someone, you\u0026rsquo;re probably predisposed to think of her suggestions as worthless.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nForget what you think about anyone. Listen with open ears. You might learn something. You might improve.\nWho knows, that suggestion might open the door to new opportunities that never existed before!\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t be able to take that action if you decide to be petty.\nNow Move Ahead\nPart of being an adult and a leader is being honest with yourself.\nYou may not like everyone. And it\u0026rsquo;s true you won\u0026rsquo;t like everyone the same no matter how hard you try. It\u0026rsquo;s okay. Commit to respecting others—no matter what—and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get things done.\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;ll be the leader you dreamed you could be.\nAnd who knows? You might just turn an enemy into a friend.\nReference McKinley, Frank. How to Lead Unwilling Followers: Strategies to Overcome Resistance (Leadership Series Book 2) . Sagacity Learning Solutions.

So what is the yardstick that determines whether or not something is important?\nYour organization\u0026rsquo;s mission statement.\nUnless you have one, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to really know what\u0026rsquo;s important. When you fight for something that\u0026rsquo;s important only to you, you come off as a dictator. But when it\u0026rsquo;s a well-known standard, you stand a better chance at being seen as a fighter for the good of everyone.\nThe second reason we fight is to set a new standard.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always the chance that someone will come along and push a boundary that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been pushed before. Your mission statement is a more general guide when this happens. As a leader, your maturity and good judgment will be your best weapon in this fight.\nAnd when you\u0026rsquo;re done, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the precedent to set a new standard.\nThe third reason we fight is to grow.\nWhen we grow from children into adults, we experience pain and bouts of awkwardness. Young people who are adult-sized don\u0026rsquo;t have the experience to match their appearance. Lessons can come from a classroom, which isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed to be pain-free. Or they can come from experience, which often has no mercy for the uneducated. Either way, you can choose to learn and be better next time. Or you can sink into bitterness and learn nothing, leaving yourself to experience the same pain again.\nNew ideas and procedures will meet resistance. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already decided it\u0026rsquo;s important enough, brace yourself to do the tough things required to make it the new normal. But also be prepared to extend the grace that is required for a new way to be universally accepted.\nCommunicate Clearly #  Conflict often comes with verbal challenges.\nHow can you be sure you don\u0026rsquo;t make the conflict personal and abusive?\nFirst, make use of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; statements.\nThis is a page out of every assertiveness training manual in print. For example, rather than say, \u0026ldquo;You make me angry\u0026rdquo;, you would say, \u0026ldquo;I feel angry about this.\u0026rdquo; Or you could say, \u0026ldquo;I feel angry about the way you handled this.\u0026rdquo; So, instead of placing the blame for your feelings on her, you take ownership of your feelings.\nThen you\u0026rsquo;ll have a chance to talk freely.\nSecond, don\u0026rsquo;t characterize someone\u0026rsquo;s arguments.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to read into something someone says. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume you know what she\u0026rsquo;s thinking. Repeat what you heard and ask her if it sounds like what she meant.\nThe temptation when you\u0026rsquo;re angry is to do the opposite. You might want to call her a babbling idiot. You might wish she\u0026rsquo;d just die of a sudden heart attack. But remember, she\u0026rsquo;s as human as you are. So give her a shot at making a difference for good.\nThird, listen intently.\nThe biggest temptation when an argument is flaming like a fiery furnace is to insert your own agenda with no consideration whatsoever for the other person\u0026rsquo;s opinion.\nIt takes a ton of patience and self-control to do the opposite.\nIf you want an argument or discussion to move forward, everyone must have his say. Otherwise, you might as well just make all the decisions yourself and just enforce them on everyone else.\nBut then you\u0026rsquo;d be dictating instead of leading.\nLeaders are listeners. They listen because they are learners. And since you can only learn so much from yourself, you need other people to make you sharper.\nSo let others have their say – and listen intently.\nWhen It\u0026rsquo;s All Over #  Fires don\u0026rsquo;t burn forever. If you leave them unattended, they die out. If you pour fuel on them, they stay alive.\nWhen you have a conflict, do your best to keep it short.\nWhen it\u0026rsquo;s over, you need to clean up quickly.\nThere are two reasons for this.\nFirst, you clean up quickly to maintain the relationship you had with the other person. Sure, the conflict probably ruffled a few feathers. But apply the outside of the sandwich approach. Help her to see after that bad experience that you are there for her, you\u0026rsquo;ll give her the help she needs, and that you too will be having the same growing pains.\nSecond, you need to follow through on any promises you made. Do this quickly or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose the momentum you got all bloody to put into motion.\nAnd if you keep your word, everyone will know you are serious.\nNow Do This #  Margaret Heffernan, bestselling author and businesswoman said, \u0026ldquo;For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate.\u0026rdquo;\nReference: McKinley, Frank.

A photon is going through airport security. The TSA agent asks if he has any luggage. The photon says, \u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m traveling light.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: \u0026ldquo;Traveling light\u0026rdquo; is a turn of phrase used to indicate traveling without much (or any) luggage. In science, a photon is a particle of light (almost always moving).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Air travel!\n2.) Pretentious? Moi?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: Only a pretentious person whose daily life doesn\u0026rsquo;t require French would actually say \u0026ldquo;moi\u0026rdquo; and mean it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s in this list because: Clocking in at two words, it\u0026rsquo;s the shortest joke in the English language.\n3.) A logician\u0026rsquo;s wife is having a baby. The doctor immediately hands the newborn to the dad. The wife says, \u0026ldquo;Is it a boy or a girl?\u0026rdquo; The logician says, \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: Processing that question through Boolean logic, \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; is technically correct. How would you answer if the question were \u0026ldquo;Is it a boy AND a girl?\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Logicians don\u0026rsquo;t get enough love.\n4.) How can you tell the difference between a chemist and a plumber? Ask them to pronounce \u0026ldquo;unionized.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: A more labor-conscious plumber would pronounce the word as \u0026ldquo;yoon-yun-ized.\u0026rdquo; A chemist would probably say \u0026ldquo;un-eye-on-ized.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: What other joke can simultaneously address the removal of charged particles from an atom as well as the organization of workers trying to achieve shared goals?\n5.) Two women walk into a bar and talk about the Bechdel test.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: The Bechdel test is a measure of gender equality in the media. A piece of media is considered to pass the test if it includes at least two women who talk to each other about something besides men. This joke passes the test.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: The media is self-referential.\n6.) Heard about that new band called 1023 MB? They haven\u0026rsquo;t had any gigs yet.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: A gigabyte is a measure of data equal to 1,024 MB. As you can see, the band is only 1,023 MB — they haven\u0026rsquo;t had any \u0026ldquo;gigs\u0026rdquo; yet.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: A lot of people probably thought one GB is a nice, round 1,000 MB.\n7.) Heisenberg was speeding down the highway. A cop pulls him over and says, \u0026ldquo;Do you have any idea how fast you were going back there?\u0026rdquo; Heisenberg says, \u0026ldquo;No, but I knew where I was.”\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: Werner Heisenberg was a German physicist and one of the key figures in quantum theory. His famous \u0026ldquo;Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\u0026rdquo; states that we can know either where a quantum particle is or how fast it\u0026rsquo;s moving, but it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to know both at the same time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s life was amazing. Seriously.\n8.) C, Eb, and G walk into a bar. The bartender says, \u0026ldquo;Sorry, no minors.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: C, Eb, and G are the musical notes that constitute a C-minor chord.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: The relationship between a major chord and its relative minor is pretty cool.\n9.) First Law of Thermodynamics: You can\u0026rsquo;t win. Second Law of Thermodynamics: You can\u0026rsquo;t break even. Third Law of Thermodynamics: You can\u0026rsquo;t stop playing.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: It\u0026rsquo;s an absolute reductionist take on the real laws of thermodynamics, and the language is such that it implies life isn\u0026rsquo;t worth living. In plain terms, the laws of thermodynamics are: Energy can\u0026rsquo;t be created or destroyed; things tend to move from order to disorder; and the lower the temperature drops, the less disorderly things become.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s in this list because: It\u0026rsquo;s actually an accurate take on thermodynamics.\n10.) If you\u0026rsquo;re not part of the solution, you\u0026rsquo;re part of the precipitate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: You were expecting the word \u0026ldquo;problem,\u0026rdquo; but the joke-teller replaced it with \u0026ldquo;precipitate,\u0026rdquo; which is the solid that forms in a solution of liquid after a chemical reaction has taken place.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Chemists are hard enough to understand as it is. Now you have a slight edge.\n11.) A linguistics professor says during a lecture that, \u0026ldquo;In English, a double negative forms a positive. But in some languages, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative. However, in no language in the world can a double positive form a negative.\u0026rdquo; But then a voice from the back of the room piped up, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, right.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: \u0026ldquo;Yeah\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; are technically affirmative words, but put these two positives together and you get an ultra-sarcastic, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, right.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: It\u0026rsquo;s true.\n12.) \u0026ldquo;This is the sort of English up with which I will not put.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: This phrase, with varying versions often attributed to Winston Churchill, is a response to the famous rule in English that a sentence isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to end in a preposition. In constructing the sentence this way, the speaker is technically correct, but it\u0026rsquo;s an incredibly awkward way to communicate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Language is complicated. Let\u0026rsquo;s mock it.\n13.) How many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? A fish.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: Surrealism is a movement all about creating weird, illogical art. As this joke makes no sense, it is itself a surrealist work.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Banana.\n14.) Knock knock. Who\u0026rsquo;s there? Knock knock. Who\u0026rsquo;s there? Knock knock. Who\u0026rsquo;s there? Knock knock. Who\u0026rsquo;s there? Philip Glass.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: Philip Glass is an American composer whose music is often described as minimalist and repetitive.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: You\u0026rsquo;ve very likely seen a few movies he scored, like \u0026ldquo;The Truman Show,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Secret Window,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Illusionist.\u0026rdquo;\n15.) Is it solipsistic in here, or is it just me?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: In philosophy, solipsism is the idea that the only thing you can be sure exists is your own mind.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: When it comes down to it, what can we really know about existence outside ourselves? Also, we\u0026rsquo;re probably living in a computer simulation.\n16.) A Roman walks into a bar and asks for a martinus. \u0026ldquo;You mean martini?\u0026rdquo; the bartender asks. The Roman replies, \u0026ldquo;Slow down there! I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know when I want more.\u0026quot;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny because: In Latin, which the Romans spoke, the suffix \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; is singular, while the suffix \u0026ldquo;i\u0026rdquo; is plural. So the Roman thinks that martini implies he\u0026rsquo;s ordering more than one! Silly Roman.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on this list because: Latin needs all the help it can get staying alive.\n17.) What does a dyslexic, agnostic, insomniac do at night?

He\u0026rsquo;s giving a progress report on the new project he\u0026rsquo;s managing and, since he wants to add some levity to his presentation, he starts off with a great new joke that landed in his e-mail box last week. But Jones doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that his \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; joke has in fact been circulating on the Internet for at least six months. Worse yet, if he\u0026rsquo;s put any rehearsal time into the joke, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show in his delivery.\nNo one laughs. Jones begins to stammer and look nervously around the room. Somehow he salvages the presentation, but it\u0026rsquo;s uphill all the way. Inwardly he vows: I\u0026rsquo;ll never use a joke again.\nRisky Business?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had a Jones-like experience, finding more ways to inject humor into your presentations probably isn\u0026rsquo;t high on your list. To your way of thinking, the risk of bombing far outweighs any gains or goodwill that might come from generating a few laughs. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re among those who believe - or work in an organizational culture that propagates the belief - that work is work, fun is fun, and never the twain shall meet. Or maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve been told all your life that you\u0026rsquo;re not a funny person, so to prove it, you wear your \u0026ldquo;I am a serious executive\u0026rdquo; persona whenever you step in front of an audience.\nBut if, as a speaker, you find yourself avoiding humor out of fear of failing, you may be overlooking one of the most powerful weapons available to you - and, possibly, undermining the effectiveness of every presentation you give. That\u0026rsquo;s because humor\u0026rsquo;s ability to poison a presentation is exceeded only by its capacity to lift it to another level.\nThe Magic of Mirth\nElusive as it may be, well-executed humor holds the power to deliver messages in an entertaining (and therefore memorable) fashion. Used intelligently, it can jolt us into seeing things from a broader perspective, enliven dull topics, diffuse tense situations and help speakers make a more human connection with their audiences.\nPsychologists have long noted that when an audience laughs with you, chances are they\u0026rsquo;ll also be for you. After a laugh, people are more receptive to the message that immediately follows it, even if it\u0026rsquo;s something they don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear. And, let\u0026rsquo;s face it: With the inherent pressures and deadly earnestness in much of today\u0026rsquo;s workplace, there\u0026rsquo;s hardly a problem with too much laughter or merry-making in the corporate work setting.\nBring Out Your \u0026ldquo;Kitchen Person\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So many managers we see are button-down and deadly serious - and so unlike the person they are in the kitchen at home, chatting with their friends,\u0026rdquo; says Cherie Kerr. The founder and CEO of ExecuProv in Santa Ana, California, Kerr teaches improvisational-comedy techniques to executives, showing them how to build more humor into presentations.\n\u0026ldquo;The reality is, we\u0026rsquo;d rather be in the company of that \u0026lsquo;kitchen person\u0026rsquo; than the guarded, inhibited one in the business setting,\u0026rdquo; Kerr continues. \u0026ldquo;Too many presenters think showing their funny or witty side isn\u0026rsquo;t acceptable in the business world. But when they show that side of themselves, everyone embraces them.\u0026rdquo;\nIn her book Simply Speaking: How to Communicate Your Ideas With Style, Substance, and Clarity, noted speechwriter Peggy Noonan says humor also serves another key purpose: \u0026ldquo;Humor is gracious and shows respect. It shows the audience you think enough of them to want to entertain them.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Joke Is On Jokes\nOne of the biggest stumbling blocks to using humor effectively is that too many presenters still equate humor with joke-telling, flashing \u0026ldquo;Dilbert\u0026rdquo; cartoons or using wacky props on the podium. Speakers also tend to mistakenly think they must generate the rolling belly laughs of Robin Williams or Chris Rock for their humor to succeed. But there\u0026rsquo;s no sin in being mildly amusing instead of eye-dabbingly funny, particularly if your humor is intimately connected to your message.\nOne problem, say many humor experts, is that delivering a good joke is never as easy as it appears. The joke must be funny in itself, get a great delivery, and fit the audience and situation. That\u0026rsquo;s a difficult trifecta for most amateur presenters to pull off.\n\u0026ldquo;Think about the jokes you receive from friends by e-mail,\u0026rdquo; says Paul Reali of CyberSkills Computer Training Centers in Greensboro, North Carolina, who discourages trainers on his staff from telling jokes. \u0026ldquo;Even when you get a really good one, you don\u0026rsquo;t forward it to everyone on your list. Instead, you select only those people who can appreciate it, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be offended by it and who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t judge you badly because you liked it.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a Sorry Joke-Teller to Do?\nSo if joke telling should be kept to a minimum, what can you do to add humor to a lackluster presentation? Plenty, say the experts. The truth is, there is a world of humor opportunity out there besides slapstick silliness and joke telling. In most cases, any appropriate humor you use will be favorably received by an audience - as long it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look too canned, and provided you get your point across.\nYou needn\u0026rsquo;t look far for someone to make fun of. For a humor alternative that packs a bigger punch and has a high \u0026ldquo;safety factor,\u0026rdquo; self-effacing humor is a good way to go, says Tom Antion, a Washington, D.C.-based presentation skills and humor consultant who himself has delivered more than 2,000 presentations. Being willing to tease yourself creates strong rapport with most audiences, he says.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve all had problems, and telling funny stories on yourself creates an impression that you\u0026rsquo;re secure, confident and likable,\u0026rdquo; Antion says. \u0026ldquo;Weak people feel the need to inflate themselves; confident people don\u0026rsquo;t. Your audience would rather hear about the time you fell on your face than when you won the race.\u0026rdquo;\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t pour it on too thick, he cautions - a little self-effacing humor goes a long way.\nYou Are Your Own Material\nWhere can you find good material if you don\u0026rsquo;t like jokes, if you think most props are sophomoric, and if you can\u0026rsquo;t for the life of you find a funny quote or cartoon to fit your content? Your life is the mother lode.\nHumorist Jeanne Robertson has been turning her own life experiences into humorous presentations to corporations and associations for more than 30 years. She first discovered that personal tales held more power than joke-telling during a reign as Miss North Carolina, when she\u0026rsquo;d tell stories about drinking from a finger bowl at a formal banquet and being shot by kids with peashooters during a small-town parade.\nGood jokes get passed around and worn out, Robertson says - speedier than ever now, owing to the Internet. Personal stories, on the other hand, are uniquely yours. Mining them also diminishes the chances an audience has already heard your material - and your supply is continually refreshed.\nRobertson estimates that 95 percent of the humorous material she uses in her 100-plus presentations a year is drawn from her own life experiences or from those around her. She\u0026rsquo;s constantly probing friends, family, co-workers and even perfect strangers for new material - what she calls her \u0026ldquo;Big Bag\u0026rdquo; philosophy, the discipline of continually filling a metaphorical bag with new material. Robertson keeps a journal so that when potentially humorous situations happen, she can immediately write them down to refine and use later - relying on complete sentences and paragraphs, she says, not just disconnected thoughts on scraps of paper.\nRobertson does have a word of caution, though: Never pretend someone else\u0026rsquo;s story happened to you, even if you\u0026rsquo;re speaking in a remote village in Greenland. If it\u0026rsquo;s a good enough story, it\u0026rsquo;ll make the rounds, and it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the risk of making a false claim in front of someone who heard it told differently elsewhere - or, worse, was part of the original story.\nMixing the Message and the Medium\nAlthough using humor for humor\u0026rsquo;s sake has its advantages, your comedy will pack far more punch if it\u0026rsquo;s tied directly to your content, or if it has a strong learning hook. \u0026ldquo;An audience will forgive you if your humor isn\u0026rsquo;t all that funny, but is connected to your message,\u0026rdquo; says Tom Antion. \u0026ldquo;If it\u0026rsquo;s funny, so much the better. But if it isn\u0026rsquo;t, at least you made your point.\u0026rdquo;\nBrian McDermott, a senior consultant with Minneapolis-based GrowthWorks Inc., ties his use of humor closely to his company\u0026rsquo;s themes of innovation and creativity training, noting that humor has long been linked with enhanced creativity, on the job and else-where. Good humorists, he says, lead listeners down a linear path, then throw in something unexpected. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s that leap to the side, the stride off the beaten path that makes us laugh, and also is a key to innovation and creativity,\u0026rdquo; he says.\nA favorite such McDermott story: Ted Turner, Jack Welch and Bill Gates all die on the same day and arrive at the Pearly Gates. God asks each to answer one question - What do you truly believe in? - before they can be granted entry. Ted Turner says: \u0026ldquo;I believe in speed and accuracy. Give people what they need quickly and reliably, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be successful.\u0026rdquo; Great, says God; come in and sit at my left hand. Jack Welch says: \u0026ldquo;I believe in product quality and being No. 1 or No. 2 in your market-place. That will make you successful and an asset to society.\u0026rdquo; Wonderful, says God; come on in. Then Bill Gates steps up. \u0026ldquo;What do you believe in?\u0026rdquo; asks God. Gates says: \u0026ldquo;I believe you\u0026rsquo;re sitting in my chair.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat If I\u0026rsquo;m Missing the Funny Gene?\nThe humorless do walk among us, of course. While some of us simply were born without the humor gene, more have had it drummed out of us by family beliefs, by bad experiences with early attempts at humor, or by corporate cultures that allow little leeway for lightheartedness amid the serious business of work.\nYet we know that many of the humor-impaired yearn to let their sense of fun out of the bag, even if they\u0026rsquo;re presenting only a few times a year. So where do these walking wounded start? By laying the groundwork, brick by brick, even if it means tooling along on training wheels for a while.\n\u0026ldquo;Someone who\u0026rsquo;s known as staunch or stoic on the job can\u0026rsquo;t just suddenly get up there and start attempting humor, especially if the audience knows them,\u0026rdquo; Antion says. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a big disconnect.\u0026rdquo; Better to start getting your humor chops on the job, he says, and let that bleed over into presentation scenarios. Try a funny line or two in a memo you\u0026rsquo;re writing; pass around a funny story sent to you via e-mail; work your way up to telling a brief story over the cubicle wall about something that happened to you. Your colleagues need to perceive your humorous side before they can embrace it when you present.\nOnce the groundwork is laid, you can move on to presentation content. Start slow with slides of funny quotes, cartoons or other props that speak for themselves and help take the pressure off you - things that say it better than you ever could.\n\u0026ldquo;People often will remember a funny quote longer than other parts of your presentation,\u0026rdquo; Cherie Kerr says.\n\u0026ldquo;I remember listening once to a long speech, little of which I recall today, except the speaker saying at the end, \u0026lsquo;And, to quote Lily Tomlin, remember that we\u0026rsquo;re all in this alone.\u0026rsquo; It was funny, but it also drove home the point she was trying to make.\u0026rdquo;\nA Spirit of Spontaneity\nTimed correctly, a humorous comment or offhand observation can be the icebreaker that makes everything else in your presentation fall into place. Leslie Brunker, a Portland, Oregon-based consultant who helps trainers extract more humor from their sessions, promotes a concept she calls \u0026ldquo;humor aikido\u0026rdquo; to help turn negative situations into positive ones.\nIn the martial art aikido, students are taught to use their opponent\u0026rsquo;s energy - what\u0026rsquo;s moving at them or against them - to their own advantage. \u0026ldquo;Instead of resisting, you use the energy flow to disarm your, opponent,\u0026rdquo; Brunker says. If you\u0026rsquo;re leading a training session with mandated attendance, for instance, and employees are showing obvious resistance to being there, \u0026ldquo;play off that resistance with humor,\u0026rdquo; she says. \u0026ldquo;Maybe talk about your own resistance as a trainer to having to teach the session, and create more of a light, we\u0026rsquo;re-all-in-this-together moment.\u0026rdquo;\nBrunker encourages business presenters and trainers to move away from humor-by-formula (\u0026ldquo;show a cartoon every 30 minutes; tell one joke in each curriculum module\u0026rdquo;). Instead, she says, you should work toward creating a light mood that encourages spontaneity and enhanced learning through mirth-making.\n\u0026ldquo;Fun and play are not always what we make happen, but what we allow to happen,\u0026rdquo; Brunker says. \u0026ldquo;We encourage that through invoking a playful spirit in the classroom, and spontaneously taking advantage of moments that arise during a session. It\u0026rsquo;s more about drawing humor out of situations than putting it in. I don\u0026rsquo;t think joke telling, for instance, connects you with an audience the way a light spirit can.\u0026rdquo;\nImprovisational Training\nRecognizing that an arsenal of jokes is not enough to ensure a successful or lively presentation, some companies are turning to improvisational-comedy training as a way to help presenters become more expressive and \u0026ldquo;in the moment\u0026rdquo; onstage. Many are also finding that such training also improves other parts of an executive\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nRitch Davidson is among those who teach improvisational techniques to corporate America. The \u0026ldquo;senior vice emperor\u0026rdquo; of Playfair Inc., an international consulting company that stresses the value of humor and fun in building creativity and productivity on the job, Davidson believes improv\u0026rsquo;s biggest benefit is the way it teaches businesspeople to be less judgmental and more collaborative. One fundamental of the improv technique is called the \u0026ldquo;yes/and\u0026rdquo; adjustment. In essence, he says, it means keeping an open mind to new ideas.\n\u0026ldquo;How many times have you been in a meeting where someone brings up a new idea, and people immediately say why it won\u0026rsquo;t work?\u0026rdquo; Davidson asks. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;Yes, but\u0026rdquo; to a new idea - essentially making it DOA - improvisation teaches players to say \u0026ldquo;Yes, and.\u0026rdquo; This gives new suggestions a chance to breathe, allowing teammates to build on them and possibly improve them.\nMuch of Playfair\u0026rsquo;s approach is supported by research, Davidson says, in particular the work of David Abramis at California State University at Long Beach. In his studies, Abramis has found that people who use humor and are playful on the job are more creative and productive, get along better with co-workers, are better decision-makers and have a lower rate of absenteeism and sick days.\nThey also make outstanding presenters. And that\u0026rsquo;s no joke.\nBy Dave_Zelinski\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/docs/02-Working-Situations/04-AECL/06_unfavorable_policy/","title":"Implement Unfavorable Policy","section":"AECL","content":"approved timecard.\nTo ensure we have a consistent approach on the use of sick leave for medical appointment.\nHR has advised that sick leave should be used for the time spent at medical appointment and the travel time to and from the appointment only (normally 1 to 4 hours).

The experimental data were more meaningful.

So, that is the work flow, how I see these method development and validation.\nAnd the other perspective about about that is from the team perspective, it because in the Lifelabs that I\u0026rsquo;m quite new, I was quite new to the environment. So, the instruments, the instrument was new. And also sample prep was new to me. And so, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely need teamwork altogether. So, to do some of the, with the lots of brainstorming, and to figure out the problems I encountered, so and also get some guidance from the team lead the how, whether that\u0026rsquo;s my, my experiment makes sense or not. So there\u0026rsquo;s so many trials on the process. So there is another part of for the measure development and validation. Yeah. And then on the instrument side, and then we can we have the so many little experiment that how do we how to optimize it instrument? How do we optimize the sample preparations. Yeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s a very complete so as a very complete, complicated project. Yeah.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s there are two there\u0026rsquo;s two scenarios I all I had experience with. So I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that see your applications that what kind of what kind there was either the complicated or not so but I my understanding that Jeremiah has developed the sample preparation sample, clashes for the micro plastic and then you are going you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re about to present to the ASTM Democrat. So yeah, so you have different different methods, development and validation has different have different perspective and definitely needs. Yeah, talent, teamwork, guidance, perseverance.\nVictoria: We also kind of have two ways of doing it where, well, I guess three, because sometimes you just have a method given to you, which is lovely. But a lot of the time, we have a compound, we know in concept how to analyze it. But we have to figure out ourselves, like, using instruments and like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, like research articles, what\u0026rsquo;s the actual process for being able to quantify this material or describe this material using our instruments? And so there\u0026rsquo;s often like, a large segment of time where we\u0026rsquo;re spending, like, like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, like optimizing the method, optimizing the sample preparation, how to read it on the instrument, optimizing the instrument conditions. Yeah. And then sometimes we have experiments where we, it\u0026rsquo;s never been quantified before, like what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at, at least to the best of our knowledge, we can\u0026rsquo;t find any information on, on how to evaluate the things we want to evaluate about a material or a compound. And so we just, we just start somewhere and try to work our way through it until we can get quantifiable data.\n Review\nHigh level. three components\n Define demand. from Workflow perspective. from teamwork perspective.

I also assume the outstanding technician, Brenda, is responsible for two LC-MS/MS, the underperforming technician, Peter, is responsible for one GC-MS. Both of them are proficient on all instruments. The one-year-old technician, Susanne, is responsible for sample processing. Brenda has been Susanne\u0026rsquo;s mentor for a year. It is time to assign work to Eric, the newly hired technician. After one year of training on the job, Susanne has demonstrated competence and is ready to learn instrumentation. I intended to form two work groups: I would put Peter and Susanne in one group having Peter train Susanne on GC/MS, and Brenda and Eric in another group having Brenda mentor Eric on sample processing. I will discuss the plan with the manager. I will explain that it is good for Susanne to learn GC/MS as a part of her career plan and help Peter when he could not deliver outcomes; it is good for Peter to have Susanne help him out; it is good for Brenda to mentor just one junior technician; it is good for Eric to be trained under the role model of employee\u0026rsquo;s mentorship. The plan would be adjusted. Once the plan is approved, I will meet with the team, putting my plan on the floor for brainstorming on how to distribute the workload between Susanne and Eric and other details. I will explain why this plan is beneficial for everyone.\nI will work with Brenda to prepare a plan to mentor Eric during his probation. Work ethic is a key factor.

Any creative writing technique can be used to improve any kind of writing.\nShall I show you?\nCreative writing examples in non-fiction\nWhen reading non-fiction, I often find myself speeding up. I try to grasp ideas quickly, and I do not pay much attention to words and sentences.\nThe ideas feel worthy of my time, the writing not.\nI’m currently read Fathoms by Rebecca Giggs. It’s a book about whales, and the relationship humans have with whales. It’s half science, half philosophy. You may think that’s a recipe for boring writing.\nBut no …\nI find myself slowing down, paying attention, savoring the words like a good wine. This is especially true for the first chapter.\nWhat makes Giggs’ writing so enjoyable?\nShe knows how to captivate her readers; she knows how to choose words; and she’s added a large dollop of creativity to her writing.\nLet me show you …\n1. Zoom in\nIn her first chapter of Fathoms, Giggs describes how whales remain part of the ecosystem after they die.\nBut she starts by zooming into the story of one specific whale—a beached humpback whale:\n I put one hand briefly on the skin of the humpback and felt its distant heartbeat, an electrical throbbing like a refrigerated truck, sealed tight. I wanted to tap on the outside of the animal and whisper to it: Are you in there, whale? Neighbour, is that you? Life on that scale — mammalian life on that scale — so unfamiliar and familiar in turns. Oh, the alien whale. The world-bound whale. A stranger inside. I hated to watch it.\n Non-fiction writing is often abstract. We want to explain trends or general tips. But such writing is hard to grasp and easy to forget.\nSo, the trick to writing engaging non-fiction is to zoom into specific stories that illustrate your points.\nFor instance, when writing a blog post with tips, share a story—real or imagined—of someone who implemented those tips. On a sales page, a testimonial can take the shape of a miniature story demonstrating how a product or service has changed one person’s life.\nStories belong everywhere, in fiction and non-fiction.\nMore detailed guidance + more examples:\nHow to weave stories into your writing: The Zoom-In-Zoom-Out technique \u0026raquo;\n2. Paint vivid imagery\nGiggs paints vivid imagery, making me feel like I’m looking over her shoulder:\n The whale was black like piano wood, and, because it was still young, it was pink in the joints under its fins. Waves burst behind it, sending spray over its back. Every few minutes, the whale slammed its flukes against the wet sand and exhaled loudly — a tantrum or leverage. Its soft chest turned slack, concertinaed by the pull of the swell.\n Can you picture the beached whale and hear it exhaling?\nVivid writing makes readers feel like they’re present in the story. Readers look through the author’s eyes, seeing what the author sees. They listen with the author’s ears, hearing what the author hears.\nReaders experience stories and that’s what makes stories memorable.\nIn non-fiction writing, you have several opportunities for painting vivid imagery. First, on a sales page, let readers imagine what it’s like to use your product or to work with you. How will you improve their lives? How will that make them feel?\nSecondly, make testimonials more like real life. Ask clients to describe in more detail what it was like to work with you. What specifically did they enjoy? And how has your service changed their lives?\nLastly, tell your own stories. For instance, on an about page or in a blog post, explain why you do what you do. What drives you? What makes your heart sing?\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: Use the 8 life forces to let readers imagine a better life \u0026raquo; How to write powerful testimonials: Templates + examples \u0026raquo; How to write an inspirational business story \u0026raquo;\n3. Hook readers\nStraight from the first sentence in Fathoms, Giggs hooks her readers.\nHere’s how her book starts:\n A few years ago, I helped push a beached humpback whale back out into the sea, only to witness it return and expire under its own weight on the shoreline.\n That sentence makes me want to learn more. Why did the humpback whale return? How did it expire under its own weight?!!???\nI read on to the second sentence, which is even more intriguing:\n For the three days that it died, the whale was a public attraction.\n So much drama is in that one sentence. How could it take the whale 3 days to die? And how could that be a public attraction? There’s so much tension in the contrast between dying and being an attraction.\nYou may think your task as a writer is to explain, to educate, to inspire, or to sell. But if you don’t hook your readers first, you won’t get an opportunity to share your ideas or to communicate your sales pitch.\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: How to hook your readers \u0026raquo;\n4. Show and tell\nThe official advice in creative writing is to “ show, don’t tell.”\nBut in practice, we often show AND tell.\nTelling means giving a brief, factual statement. Showing means using sensory details and describing actions to direct a mental movie in your reader’s mind.\nFor instance, here’s how Giggs tells us how oceans were feared in the past:\n People once feared there was a terrible, existential emptiness in the ocean, an unpeopled and unending openness.\n It’s an example of telling because we can’t visualize it. It’s simply a statement of people’s existential fear of the emptiness in the ocean.\nHere’s how Giggs finds a way to show this is true:\n In antiquity, cartographers populated the seaward frontiers of their maps with drolleries. Hand-drawn pictograms, drolleries are whales hybridised with sea serpents; monsters adorned with antlers and tusks, scales and sprigs of feathers.\n Showing requires a writer’s ingenuity to find an example that can demonstrate that a statement is true. It not only increases credibility, but also makes the writing more interesting.\nSo, each time you make a generic or abstract statement, ask yourself: How can I demonstrate this is true? Can I share an example or two?\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: 18 show don’t tell examples \u0026raquo;\n5. Play with your words\nThe usual writing advice is to use the words everyone else is using, right?\nYes, plain language helps make your writing easy to read.\nBut your writing doesn’t need to sound like everyone else. You can add a little flourish here or there to let your personality shine through.\nFor instance, Giggs uses sensory language to help us imagine what it’s like to hear a whale breathe:\n Stood ankle-deep on the beach at night, you hear them. That is, you hear the whales breathing. How the sound carries across the water, I do not know. A whale sneezes: you jump. It sounds like a roller-door slamming.\n And note the strong verbs Giggs uses to describe the sociable noises that humpback whales make:\n The whales grunt, rasp, thwop, and moan; they shriek, whine, bubble, gurgle, and fin-slap on the sea’s topside, as well as generating what are called ‘pulse trains’: subsonic resonances, only recently discovered, that thump across the lower thresholds of human hearing like rain drubbing a tarp.\n The words you choose help create your writing voice so readers can recognize your writing and look forward to hearing from you again.\nSo, when you’ve finished a blog post or a sales page, look for two or three important sentences, and then play with the words. How can you make your words more powerful?\nMore detailed guidance + more examples: How to use sensory language (even in business writing!) \u0026raquo; 351 strong verbs to make your writing pop, fizz, and sparkle \u0026raquo; 172+ powerful words to add magic to your writing \u0026raquo;\nImagine your reader …\nIt’s Monday morning 8 A.M.\nShe feels tired, a slight headache. The weekend was far too short.\nShe switches on her computer and checks her inbox, while sipping green tea.\nThere’s your email …\nWill she click away, uninterested in more dry advice?\nOr is there a story to engage her?\nAre her eyes lighting up because she’s delighted to hear from you?\nBook mentioned in this post: The link below is an Amazon affiliate link.

Frequently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t; often you crash and burn. This is part and parcel of pursuing and achieving very ambitious goals. It is also one of the profound lessons I have learned during my career, namely, that even when you have an organization brimming with talent, victory is not always under your control. Rather, it’s like quicksilver—fleeting and elusive, not something you can summon at will even under the best circumstances. Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo;. \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nAlways the same principle was present: There is no guarantee, no ultimate formula for success. \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nHowever, a resolute and resourceful leader understands that there are a multitude of means to increase the probability of success. And that’s what it all comes down to, namely, intelligently and relentlessly seeking solutions that will increase your chance of prevailing in a competitive environment. When you do that, the score will take care of itself. - Location 405\nI had no grandiose plan or timetable for winning a championship, but rather a comprehensive standard and plan for installing a level of proficiency—competency—at which our production level would become higher in all areas, both on and off the field, than that of our opponents. Beyond that, I had faith that the score would take care of itself. - Location 734\nI directed our focus less to the prize of victory than to the process of improving—obsessing, perhaps, about the quality of our execution and the content of our thinking; that is, our actions and attitude. I knew if I did that, winning would take care of itself, and when it didn’t I would seek ways to raise our Standard of Performance. At least, that was my plan. It may not sound very grandiose, but it was very comprehensive and was the platform from which I launched the turnaround. - Location 745\nIn many ways, it comes down to details. The intense focus on those pertinent details cements the foundation that establishes excellence in performance. The simplest correct execution of procedures represents the commitment of players and staff to the organization and the organization to them. Specifics such as “shirttails in,” understanding and respecting the jobs of others in the organization, running exactly ten yards and not ten yards fifteen inches, exhibiting a positive attitude, answering the phones professionally, seeing the team as an extension of yourself—all contribute in varying degrees to a devotion to high standards visible to everyone. The self-image of the 49ers as a first-class professional outfit was nurtured and carefully developed in these incremental ways. That’s what I focused on, knowing that if I did so, winning would take care of itself. - Location 885\nControl What You Can Control: Let the Score Take Care of Itself. - Location 1372\nOne of the common traits of outstanding performers—coaches, athletes, managers, sales representatives, executives, and others who face a daily up/down, win/lose accounting system—is that a rejection, that is, defeat, is quickly forgotten, replaced eagerly by pursuit of a new order, client, or opponent. They know that a defeat, whether a lost account or a loss on the field, can’t be taken personally. Like Bud Grant, they shake it off and go forward. And so must you.\nIn my early days, I did this too. I firmly believed that if I took care of my job the score would take care of itself. When it didn’t, I worked even harder to improve my coaching and elevate the Standard of Performance of our team. This was one of the reasons I drove myself so relentlessly. But gradually I found it harder and harder to accept my concept that the “score will take care of itself.” I became consumed with how the score would take care of itself, whether it would be in a manner that resulted in victory for me. I became overwhelmed with worry about that score and lost sight of the fact that in a fight you go as hard as you can, do all you’re capable of doing, knowing that ultimately, while you can influence the result to a greater or lesser degree, you do not control the result. If your hard work is coupled with intelligence and talent, you may win. If not, you go back to work and get ready for the next fight without feeling that somehow, having given it everything you’ve got (as I did for ten years), you are somehow inadequate as a person, that you didn’t measure up. You can’t let that happen to yourself. - Location 4507\n"},{"id":91,"href":"/docs/03-Soft-Skills/02-Communication/02_Two_way_communication/","title":"Two-Way Communication: 4 Tips for a More Engaged Workplace","section":"Communication","content":"  You know the reality – employees who are highly engaged in their work perform better than their less-committed counterparts and boost the organization’s bottom line.\nOne of the most critical elements to employee engagement is two-way communication in the workplace. You might wonder why I add the words two-way to my description since it’s inherent in the definition, yet in consulting with leaders I continue to see a lot of communication that actually is information, since it lacks back and forth that’s critical to communication, among other problems.\nTennis, anyone? #  My Dad and I played a lot of tennis growing up. It was one of the few sports where I was coordinated enough to be successful as a lanky kid. In my teens, he turned his passion into a business, starting a boutique tennis store called, “The Wimbledon Shoppe” in the suburb of Milwaukee where I grew up.\nHe was the star tennis player in high school, and that was his wish for me, which was more of a pipe dream, I knew. While I had a killer two-handed back hand, I couldn’t serve worth a darn. And you can’t win, if you can’t serve well.\nSo, I hung up my Prince racket, put away my Tretorn-trainer, and focused my attention on my front counter job at my local McDonald’s. There, I could serve with the best of them!\nWhat is two-way communication? #  Tennis is a great analogy for two-way communication. Great matches are filled with great volleys. Likewise, to be most effective, think about two-way communication as a dialogue or conversation that goes back and forth. Doing this helps to ensure several important conditions for making our efforts most successful:\n We plan our most important communications so we can be purposeful and increase our chances of achieving our outcome We are focused on our audience and where they are coming from, not on what we think and want to get across, so they are in the best position to hear and understand what we’re sharing We allow sufficient time for a back and forth discussion; we listen as much or sometimes even more than we speak. We listen for what’s being said and as importantly, what’s not being said We are open to feedback and pose questions that facilitate this kind of interaction; feedback is also used to frame future communications We regularly check for understanding to confirm a shared meaning with our audience  How to Use Two-Way Communication in the Workplace #  Leaders who understand the importance of effective two-way communication – and how you can’t lead without communicating well – engage employees with various communication channels that help them connect the dots between individual efforts and organizational goals.\nBut just as important as any leadership message is having systems in place to gather employee input and demonstrate its importance to the organization. By establishing channels to encourage and funnel feedback from employees to leaders, you create a critical structure to support employee engagement.\nHere are 4 ways to leverage two-way communication for increased employee engagement:\n1. Understand your audience and what’s important to them\nThe top priority for building engagement is to give employees information they need to succeed in their jobs, and ensure they know where to find additional resources. The type of organization, job and level of employee will dictate the most effective channel to meet your needs. Your efforts will be most effective if you first ask yourself, “What is the most important thing these employees want to know, what is the best way to encourage dialogue and how would they be most comfortable sharing input?\n2. Choose or create channels\nOnce you consider the audience and work environment, look at the best ways to engage employees to share their ideas and insights. You may use existing channels or create new ones. Keep in mind feedback channels can be informal – such as leaders “ managing by walking around” or supervisors asking for input – or they can be more formal mechanisms that invite ideas and questions via print or technology. When determining which channels work best, keep in mind employees’ time commitment, availability and access to technology. Be sure they can use feedback mechanisms both during and after work hours.\n3. Gather and encourage feedback\nOnce you are ready to implement and promote feedback channels throughout the organization, recognize that what you do with their input speaks volumes to employees. When leaders respond quickly to ideas and questions, employees get the message their input is valued and they become more committed and engaged. To ensure feedback gets the respect it deserves, assign someone to respond personally and promptly to all employee concerns and ideas.\n4. Act on feedback\nHighly engaged employees are enthused about their organization and believe they can positively influence its success. Acting on employee feedback and highlighting the impact employees make is a strong engagement builder. Be sure that all employees know how their colleagues’ suggestions or ideas are being implemented. Regularly sharing results and requesting additional feedback creates predictable, consistent two-way communication that encourages employees to take ownership and understand their ideas are valued by the organization.\nWhy is two-way communication important? #  The importance of building opportunities for solid two-way communication – dialogues and conversations – really can’t be underestimated. When our two-way communication is well planned and executed, the benefits to our organizations include:\n Heightened levels of job satisfaction by offering an outlet for employee concerns, ideas, opinions Increased productivity because ambiguity about roles/responsibilities/actions is reduced Enhanced collaboration across the organization, which can lead to more creativity and innovation Improved trust between leadership and employees, which builds internal brand loyalty and offers opportunities for continued growth  What one step can you take to further encourage two-way communication, increase employee feedback and reap the benefits of doing so?\n— author: David Grossman #  Armed with these 15 practical tips, you’ll be able to encourage two-way communication, increase employee feedback, enhance collaboration, increase productivity and reap the many more benefits of doing so.\nReference leadercommunicatorBLOG\n"},{"id":92,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/11-CGC-QA-2016/Interview/02_health_safety/","title":"HPTA Application to GRL","section":"Interview","content":"Question 3: To which extent does the HPTA apply to the work of the Grain Research Laboratory? Response: The key objective of Human Pathogen and Toxins Act (HPTA) and Regulations (HPTP) is to make working with human pathogens and toxins safer, more secure and less burdensome for those dealing with lower risk pathogens.\nThe HPTA does not apply to: •\ta human pathogen or toxin in an environment in which it naturally occurs, as long as it has not been cultivated or intentionally collected or extracted. •\tany activity that is a controlled activity within the meaning of the Assisted Human Reproduction Act. Under the HPTA, the facility needs to develop a program and regulatory framework on the following: •\tLicense: procedures required to engage in controlled activities. •\tBiological Safety Officers: qualifications and training required and roles identified in regulations. •\tSecuring screening: requirements needed for access.\n•\tLaboratory incidents: reporting on laboratory acquired infections.\nI observed on the GRL website that the microbiology program of the GRL monitors and carries out surveillance of high-risk pathogenic, quarantine and toxigenic microorganisms in exported grain. Based on the limited knowledge, the microbiology laboratory operation should be regulated under the HPTA.\nThe GRL shall develop a program to oversee the practice. The GRL shall get a license.

One individual needs encouragement, another individual may need more follow-ups during the progress. The current laboratory I am working in provides analysis service to internal clients. The turn-around-time was an issue recently. The Environmental Specialist did not get results on time to address environmental accidents ahead of time. The management got excited about it.\nAs a senior role in the laboratory, I took initiative to organize a weekly toolbox meeting within our group last year. The purpose of the meeting was to address backlogged analysis by refocusing on priorities, addressing any issues with collective efforts, and helping the team.\nI also played a role to communicate between the team and the management/the Environmental Specialist. There was a weekly meeting with my manager last year. It did not take long time every time. We discussed weekly update and the insight of the laboratory operation. I provided a list of backlogged samples to the Environmental Specialist weekly.\nWith the training sessions on dealing with difficult personality and negaholics, and the manager’s mentorship, I took an inside-out approach to address issues with different lens. I did my best to motivate each individual by applying different approach. I did more recognition to a technologist who is constantly productive. I sent a recognition note to the manager for the performance appraisal. I brought attention of a technologist’s poor performance to the manager. We came up solutions to work out the situation.\nThe laboratory operation ended up with good performance last year with efforts from management and peers. Management is an art. I am on the journey.

After all, we can all get an audience to laugh at us, but the key is understanding how to get them to laugh with us!\nLaugh Lovers was inspired by the late John Cantu, a humorist and comedy coach who once managed the Holy City Zoo comedy club in San Francisco. It was there that comedians such as Robin Williams and Dana Carvey got their start. Back then, they too were learning to be funny. John relished the role of \u0026ldquo;humor helper\u0026rdquo; to comedians, fellow Toastmasters and members of the National Speakers Association world-wide. John believed we could all become funnier with practice and an appreciation of the rules of comedy.\nLaugh Lovers carries on the tradition Cantu started, of helping Toastmasters be funnier. I recently talked to Jeff_Heidner, corporate humorist and Laugh Lovers club president, about how Toastmasters can create and deliver funnier material.\nHere are Jeff\u0026rsquo;s top 10 tips on how Toastmasters can be funnier:\n Be Yourself. The world already has a Bill Cosby, Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need another one. Yet there is room for your unique brand of humor. What\u0026rsquo;s your brand? That\u0026rsquo;s your first assignment. Whenever you\u0026rsquo;re conversing with some-one and you say something that makes them laugh, that\u0026rsquo;s a clue! That\u0026rsquo;s your unique brand of humor. Take Notes. Whenever you say something that makes someone else laugh, write it down. And don\u0026rsquo;t forget to write down how you said it, and the context in which it was said. Otherwise, when you look back at it a month later you may find yourself wondering, \u0026ldquo;What was so funny about that?\u0026rdquo; Just the process of committing your amusing articulations to paper will go a long way toward helping you discover, develop and define your unique sense of humor. Pepper your speeches with humor. Just as pepper spices up your favorite dish, you can (and should) use humor to season your speeches. Sprinkle humor into your next speech to grab the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention. When used as an accent, humor adds just the right amount of flavor without over-powering everything else. Use humor to accent the important points in your speech and your audience will remember those points long after they\u0026rsquo;ve left the presentation. Special delivery recommended. How you deliver your material is key. I\u0026rsquo;ve performed with many comedians who are talented writers but don\u0026rsquo;t get laughs on stage. They get so frustrated when they see comedians who are lesser writers \u0026ldquo;bring the house down\u0026rdquo; at will. The next few steps offer delivery suggestions: Use your voice. Toastmasters teaches us the importance of using vocal variety in our speeches. It\u0026rsquo;s just as important, if not more so, when using humor. Change your inflection, use characters and establish different voices for each one. For added impact, fluctuate your volume. Doing so will help you create vivid images in the minds of your audience members, heightening the laughter you will garner. Timing is everything. WARNING: Please pause prior to proceeding with the punch line. First, you need to be sure your audience has digested the setup before you launch into the punch line; if they don\u0026rsquo;t get the joke, you won\u0026rsquo;t get the laughter! Second, by pausing just a beat or two after your setup, you create that much more tension and, consequently, induce that much more laughter. Surprise. Humor and tension go hand in hand. When you set up your audience for a moment of levity, you create tension. When you deliver the punch line - or the twist or surprise - you allow for that tension to be released. That release is manifested in the form of laughter. Stay clean. No, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about washing behind your ears. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about using humor that is appropriate for the audience you\u0026rsquo;re addressing. Remember, humor is supposed to make people feel good - not embarrassed, insulted or offended. Stay away from comments that are sexist, racist, ageist or otherwise controversial. Of course, if you want to make fun of yourself, go right ahead. Self-deprecating humor is a great way to put your audience at ease with you as a speaker so that they can get to know you as a person. Write-minded. Write, rewrite and write some more! The more you think about your sense of humor, the more you\u0026rsquo;ll notice the funny things you say to your friends; the more you practice using your sense of humor in your speeches, the more comfortable you\u0026rsquo;ll be with it. If your audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t think your funny line is so funny, then play with it, tweak it, rearrange it and try it again. Have fun. That\u0026rsquo;s a direct order! If you don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy delivering it, then how can you expect an audience to laugh at it? Humor is contagious.  Jeff and Craig agree on one more point: Toastmasters, You Cantu Be Funny!\nBy Craig_Harrison\nRecommendations #  Craig and Jeff recommend:\n Use Toastmasters' advanced speech manuals, such as Humorously Speaking and The Entertaining Speaker, to help you hone your humor skills. Take an improv class. Like Table Topics, improvisational theater will help you think and speak on your feet, appreciate audience dynamics and overcome speaking fears through experimentation. Use Table Topics as opportunities to create and relieve tension through humor, work on your timing and utilize the element of surprise for comedic effect. Study successful humorists, comedians and storytellers. Observe the histrionics of Bill Cosby, John Cleese and Carol Burnett. Study the timing of Cedric the Entertainer, Billy Crystal and Steve Martin. Analyze the mannerisms of stand-up comedians such as Jay Leno, Whoopi Goldberg and Eddie Izzard. Admire the writing in television shows like MASH** and Seinfeld where many laughs are written into the dialogue.

I got both bachelor degree and master degree. After schooling, I once worked at an international chemicals company in China. capital project management and a lab consultant where I traveled a lot to manufacturing plants within company and supported QC departments. I actually enjoy travelling, I read more books than I was at home, I got more things done than I was a home. Bryce told me, in this job, I donot take trips for overnight quite often, but on the road instead. When I am on the road, I listened audio books, youtube. It would be better to install a hifi module on the fleet if it is okay with the company. My wife and I donot have kids, so there is no issue from family. Then I worked at SGS providing technical support to testing service. In 2004, we immigrated to Canada, I firstly worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs where I was a chemist as well as quality manager. The owner bought second-hand instruments. I had opportunity to do maintenance and troubleshooting in order to keep the instrument in good shape and save money. I also provided technical service to clients. The company is located in Northern Ontario. It was a culture shock, weather wise, community wise, language wise. The hiring manager at AECL asked me: how far away is the Walmart store? It take an hour to go to the nearest Walmart. In 2009, a job opening came up at AECL in Manitoba. They hired me in their environmental lab to support a decommissioning project. I worked there for 7 years. Due to the union working environment, I monitored the instrument performance, and provided advice. The technologists took corrective actions. Pinawa is also a remote area. 1.5 hour driving from Winnipeg, 1500 residents, no traffic lights. I enjoy living there. The problem there is there are not many jobs. When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off. Before I landed at LifeLabs, I did customer service at HR Block. self-learned R. started up my own business, and got involved in community voluntary works. After I returned to the workplace at LifeLabs in British Columbia. I spent first three months to develop two visualization applications to monitor instrument performance and data quality, one is to monitor instrument parameters, another one is to visualize data trends. I also developed checklists to identify problems when doing troubleshooting. I spent last three months at LifeLabs\nAs you can see, instrument maintenance and troubleshooting is part of my responsibilities throughout my career. I have built skills to develop creative approaches to managing maintenance and troubleshooting.\nInterview Review #  "},{"id":103,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/05-NAIT/Second-Interview/","title":"Second Interview","section":"NAIT","content":"Second Interview #  Date:\nInterview Panel:\n 2022-May-26\nKelsey Deutsch, M Sc. in Analytical Chemistry, kdeutsch@nait.ca Victoria Collins, Doctoral Candidate in Microbiology, ccollins@nait.ca\nOptional: Nick Stadnyk nstadnyk@nait.ca\n  #  Second Interview #  Interview Questions I Prepared #  null\nInterview Questions They asked #    Which character in Star Wars do you consider to be?\n  Why do you think you are the best fit?\n  What challenges do you think at the new position?\n  Are you comfortable on running ICP-OES?\n  How did you develop method?\n  Your experience with GC/MS, GPC, TGA.\n  Interview Questions I asked #    What does your daily work look like?\n  Would I have chance to operate instrument?

A comprehensive method was developed for detecting quantitatively 32 compounds, including benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene (BTEX). We ran proficiency test (PT) tests with this method.\nDuring our routine analysis, we ran samples for BTEX with a shortlisted method in which there were only BTEX to cut off the time to process data.\nTwo VOCs mixes were purchased. Styrene was added to a commercially available ATG-17, and the rest of the 32 compounds came from another mix called ATG-16. Even though we used the customized ATG-17 for the routine analysis, we did not report styrene.\nI used to purchase standard mixes by myself during the method development and validation. A technologist took over the responsibility after the analysis was put into production. When I purchased the new standard mix, I forgot to mention we need the customized ATG-17, not the commercial ATG-17.\nThere was a time new standard mixes were purchased without noticing styrene was not in the mix. Routine BTEX testing went well. It was until we failed on styrene at a PT that we realized we purchased the wrong ATG-17. We found out by overlaying the styrene peaks with previous ones, the peaks were significantly lower than those before.\nIf the error was not noticed, and we ran routine samples for styrene, it would be a severe problem.\nI asked the technologist to reorder the customized ATG-17 right away. In the meantime, I prepared technical specification documents for standards for procurement references.\nThis mistake happened occasionally.\nFurthermore, I learned from this mistake and developed an R Shiny application at LifeLabs to visualize all historical data of samples, including calibrators, QCs, internal standards, and a critical parameter of GC-MS/MS.

So the first thing leaders should learn is how to listen and take feedback.\nTwo-way communication is used to transmit more complex messages, brainstorm, and make arrangements.\nExamples of two-way communication are: staff meetings, face-to-face conversations, video calls, phone calls, etc.\nChallenges in two-way communication: language barriers, overload of irrelevance, lack of channels, lack of culture of employee feedback, lack of empathy and transparency, lack of acting on employee feedback,\n A common issue that often plagues organizations, both big and small, is the underutilization of two-way communication in the workplace.\nTwo-way communication is an important factor that influences trust and employee engagement within an organization. It encourages a free flow of information in both directions, and facilitates constant growth of both leaders and employees.\nThe more deliberate encouragement of two-way communication within internal workplace communication systems is one of the many steps leading modern organizations in a good direction.\nIn this article, we explore the concept of two-way communication, the reasons why it should be considered the most important aspect of any organization, and what you can do to make it work in your company.\n 1. What is two-way communication? #  Imagine two-way communication as a tennis match. Once the ball is served, the player on the other end is meant to return it — otherwise, there’s no game.\nThis continuous back and forth between two or more players is what makes the game possible, and it’s also what makes it interesting. Playing in an empty court, not allowing anyone else to participate, and expecting the audience to stay invested in the game is unrealistic, to say the least.\nCommunication in the workplace functions in a similar way. Talking at people, instead of talking to them causes apathy and lack of motivation in employees, which reflects in their overall engagement and job performance. Motivated, engaged, and productive employees are the ones who feel that their voice is heard — who feel that they are working with the management, and not for the management. In other words, unlike one-way communication, two-way communication encompasses both upward (from employees to managers) and downward communication (from managers to employees).\n2. Two-way vs one-way communication #  Two-way and one-way communication are two very important types of internal communication. They both have a part to play in building an open and efficient communication system in the workplace. But, to use them effectively, we must first understand the differences between them.\n3. Reasons to improve internal two-way communication #  Relying on downward communication alone won’t take your business endeavors far. After all, two-way communication encourages an upward flow of information. Here are the four main reasons why an unimpeded and transparent flow of information in both directions is good for your business.\n3.1. Two-way communication prevents information overload #  Consider the age we live in — phones, laptops, tablets, PCs — most people can find at least one of these devices at arms reach at any point during the day. On these devices, we are greeted with an overflowing inbox, social media notifications galore, and an endless scroll of news and click-bait articles lurking around every corner.\nIt’s no coincidence that the stream of new content on any app or social media is called a feed — we are constantly being fed debatably relevant information. In our private lives, or at work, the situation is the same — especially now, with remote work becoming more popular.\nTo avoid being one of the numerous sources “feeding” employees irrelevant information, employers should consider personalizing their messages.\nPersonalization is one of the traits of two-way communication. It encourages responsiveness and feedback by speaking directly to the employee, instead of the entire organization. Its other important usage is to prevent employees from having to waste their working hours by reading information that has nothing to do with them, because the sender couldn’t bother to address it to the right people.\nTherefore, two-way communication creates a way to make relevant information more easily accessible and clearly discernible, reducing information overload in the process.\n3.2. Job satisfaction hinges on open two-way communication #  Employee turnover is a costly issue for companies all across the globe, and it’s inextricably tied to job satisfaction.\nIt’s only logical that people who aren’t satisfied with their jobs are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management reveals that “respectful treatment of all employees at all levels” is the main factor that influences employee satisfaction. This is further supported by Gallup’s study of 7,272 U.S. adults, which points to managers as the main culprits for employees quitting their jobs. Apparently, the popular phrase “people leave managers, not companies” is true.\nThe study reveals that one of the things employees value most in managers are approachability and the effort to engage in daily communication. According to our statistics, people want to feel that they are part of the team and that their contributions matter. The best way to make this possible is to communicate.\nTwo-way communication is a key element in establishing a fruitful work environment based on mutual trust. Not only does it prevent valuable employees from leaving, but it further boosts their performance by making them want to work, rather than have to work.\n3.3. Two-way communication leads to trust and loyalty at the workplace #  According to research by Innsbruck’s University School of Management, the major drivers of employee satisfaction are trust and loyalty. The authors of the research claim that trust and loyalty have a direct influence on the quality of performance due to their positive impact on motivation and morale. However, they point out that it’s not only the trust in management that matters, but also the trust in peers, especially in more modern, team-based environments.\nThe main question, then, is, how do companies build that trust? Most business leaders agree that effective internal communication is the key to building a trusting work environment. That said, a staggering 91% of employees believe their managers lack good communication skills.\nAssuming that managers lead by example, this statistic implies it’s impossible to foster trust and loyalty without a democratic attitude toward internal workplace communication that comes from the top. This entails not only allowing employees to voice their opinions, but actively listening and acting on that feedback. Nothing breaks the mirage of open communication quite as effectively as a pile of employee complaints left unaddressed.\n3.4. Two-way communication drives employee engagement #  There’s evidence to suggest that employee engagement leads to employee empowerment, higher retention rates, and greater profitability, among other things. It’s strongly linked to job satisfaction, and highly dependent on trust and two-way communication at work.\nFree and open internal communication leads to good relationships, a lack of fear toward expressing opinions, and, therefore, to continuous constructive dialogue that propels a business to new heights. Employees who work in a mutually supportive environment tend to have a personal investment in the business. This is then reflected in their attitude toward business partners and customers, and directly influences the success and public opinion of the organization.\n4. How to improve two-way communication in the workplace #  Now that we’ve covered some of its major benefits, we’ll go about explaining how exactly to improve two-way communication in order to ensure optimal results in the workplace.\n4.1. Use the right communication channels #  A big part of establishing good communication is understanding your audience, i.e. your employees. A good example of this are Millennials. There is still a mix of tech-savvy and not-so-tech-savvy generations in the workforce, but Millennials currently comprise the majority of the U.S. workforce.\nAccording to Businesswire, Millennials don’t enjoy phone calls or face-to-face communications. Instead, they mostly prefer messaging platforms (55%), with a smaller percentage (28%) choosing emails as their preferred mode of business communication. As a Millennial myself, I can attest to this.\nSo, instead of forcing an unwanted means of communication upon employees, it would be more effective to make communication comfortable for employees by analyzing their preferences and meeting them on their own turf.\nHow internal communication software improves two-way communication\nMost of us are familiar with feeling bogged down by an overflowing inbox, and the frustration of being unable to find the information we need among those emails. And it’s no wonder, considering that, according to some research, an average office employee receives 121 emails every day. Adobe has even calculated that some employees spend over five hours a day checking emails, both business and personal — which is an absurd number.\nWhile it’s impossible to avoid using emails in business communication, one way to circumvent these issues is to use internal communication software. Internal communication software is built to mimic regular chat apps most people use on a daily basis. As such, they encourage a more free and informal type of communication. This makes employees feel relaxed and more likely to share their thoughts and opinions with each other, fostering a healthy and unimpeded flow of information within an organization. And, unlike emails, the exchange of messages is instantaneous.\nOne way that Pumble, our internal communication software, encourages feedback is through the use of reaction emojis. Even if someone is short on time, or insecure about sharing their opinion in words, a simple reaction emoji can go a long way in encouraging people to express themselves.\n Reacting to messages with emojis in Pumble\n4.2. Personalize information #  To better understand how to improve two-way communication by personalizing information, let’s look at an example.\nImagine Joe.\nJoe is a department leader in an organization that mostly uses one-way communication to deliver news and updates to their staff. On a given day, about half of the emails he receives are subscription newsletters — and the rest, important contacts he needs to get back to.\nOccasionally, Joe receives an email from his boss. These emails are normally sent to all employees and hardly ever have anything remotely to do with the work he does. Joe opens email after email from his boss, and finds nothing that concerns him, so after a while, he starts mentally throwing those emails in the same “irrelevant, might open later” pile, along with his subscription newsletters. One day, Joe gets a call to his boss’ office, only to find that he was meant to attend a meeting that morning along with all the other department leaders, and he knew nothing about it because he failed to open the email.\nLooking at it from a traditionalist’s perspective, the fault lies entirely with Joe. He received an email from his superior, and his duty was to open it because there might have been something important in it. However, the focus here is “might have been”.\nExpecting employees to waste valuable time during their work hours to read emails that contain information completely unrelated to them and their work is unreasonable and unproductive.\nTaking just a few minutes to make sure the emails or channel messages in internal collaboration apps are addressed to the right people can make a big difference. It prevents other employees from being distracted by irrelevant information, ensures that the right people always receive the message, and makes the ensuing exchange of information a lot more personalized.\n Tagging team members in Pumble\n4.3. Practice transparency #  The road to an open and trusting work environment is through communicational transparency. According to Michigan State University, the definition of transparency in communication is “the act of both good and bad information being shared upward, downward, and laterally in a way that allows all to see the why behind the words”. According to them, some of the benefits of transparent internal communication include the following:\n Better collaboration More creative innovation Increased trust More open communication Free sharing of ideas More informed workplace  By showing a willingness to be honest and transparent in their communication with employees, employers set a good example, and encourage employees to do the same. Transparency removes communication barriers and breeds healthy internal communication that flows in both directions.\n4.4. Ensure leadership training #  Leaders are the ones meant to set an example for the employees to follow. Problems arise when people are promoted to a leadership position without proper training and expected to do an amazing job.\nWe are often told that someone is “a born leader”, but there is no such thing. Leaders learned how to lead through experience. Dave Jennings, WSJ bestselling author, and author of the book “The Pit of Success: How Leaders Adapt, Succeed and Repeat”, said it well, “You are not in your job because you have all the answers; you are in your job because you have what it takes to find the answers”.\nThe best way to teach leaders how to be leaders is to teach them how to take advice, how to take criticism, and when to concede and admit they are wrong. But in order to do this, the organization needs an environment where giving such constructive feedback to your superiors is encouraged. So the first thing leaders should learn is how to listen and take feedback.\n4.5. Practice empathy #  One of the biggest mistakes employers make is setting unrealistically high expectations for their employees, and expecting everyone to perform at their maximum capacity at all times. But each person is a unique individual with their own lives and their own chain of problems that they don’t just leave behind when they come to work. In fact, our personal lives often bleed heavily into our professional lives and inevitably affect our performance. This is something author and inspirational speaker, Simon Sinek, talks about in his speech about leadership and empathy.\nTwo-way communication in the workplace helps employers understand their employees. Being friends with everyone in their charge is impossible, but at least a basic level of interest and empathy toward employees is necessary to build a trusting relationship.\nEmployers who know nothing about their employees are detached and tempted to look at workers as machines. On the other hand, employers who communicate with their employees might find out that someone’s child is sick, or one of their family members passed away, and show understanding if that employee’s productivity drops. This kind of show of kindness can be much more effective in building loyalty in employees than a raise can.\n4.6. Provide feedback #  Most managers dislike giving feedback, but feedback is an essential part of employee development, and it’s necessary to build confidence in an employee, along with a sense of direction to their work.\nHowever, feedback shouldn’t flow in only one direction. Instead of forming feedback as a lecture or a list of items to be improved upon, consider forming it as a constructive discussion. Good feedback is a two-way conversation — by shifting the tone and manner of the feedback, the session turns into a more pleasant experience.\n4.7. Encourage feedback #  Besides the usual, top-down feedback most companies practice, any company dedicated to fostering free, and open-minded internal communication should also encourage upward feedback.\nUpward feedback is a touchy topic in most companies because it asks employees to criticize their managers or bosses. Few are fearless enough to do that outside of exit interviews, if then. But that’s just it. Fear should have no place in an organization with a well-rounded internal communication system.\nIn fact, one way an employer knows they’ve made two-way communication at their workplace successful is when all communication barriers are gone. In such an environment, employees are able to communicate their thoughts and ideas without fear of being judged, reprimanded, or worse yet, penalized.\n5. Wrapping up: Successful two-way communication is based on continuous dialogue #  Building a successful internal communication system with two-way communication at its heart is not rocket science. In fact, it’s based more on basic common sense than anyone would initially think. The one difference is that employers, wrapped up in their own business endeavors, tend to forget that people who work for them are, well… people.\nWhat two-way communication helps employers do is get a new perspective, and all it takes is the willingness to engage in both casual and professional dialogue.\nAuthor: Jelena Kalaba is a bookworm and productivity nerd, constantly in search of new ways to make her daily workflow more effective.

Whenever we are hurled into a crisis that brings tears, our tendency is to retreat or recoil in fear and hurt. However, there is a better way that God tells us to handle such times of travail.\n\u0026ldquo;He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him\u0026rdquo; (Ps. 126:5-6).

This is one of the most important lessons I have learned when faced with difficult circumstances. Rather than sit back and allow self-pity and discouragement to consume us, we should plant seed during this time. Reach out to a person who needs a friend. Invest in the life of another. See where you can be a blessing to someone. Give of yourself.\n\u0026ldquo;You must not let the circumstances destroy you!

Why is it necessary to follow these instructions?\n Response:\nA quality principle is “we do what we say; and we say what we do”. We expect to get reliable analysis results in a safe manner by everyone following standardized operating procedures. Any deviation from the procedures could result in one of the following consequences:\n It could be a safety issue. There was an incident recently in a facility where a sample vessel used in a microwave digestion device was blown up. The investigation found out that the analyst failed to follow the manufacturers’ recommendation for the safe, effective use of equipment that was incorporated into operating instructions/procedures. It is a non-conformance issue from the quality management perspective. The methods of analysis were developed based on reference methods and validated. They were deemed ‘fit for use’ by method validation data. Any deviations are not considered ‘fit for use’ unless further validation proves such deviations will not affect the data quality, and such deviations are examples of method ruggedness. An oven temperature change was found in our recent external audit. The oven temperature setting was changed and it was not corrected. As a result, we submitted validation data to prove that the data quality was not compromised. It could affect the instrument performance if we did not follow the manufacturers’ recommendation of maintenance. A recent observation of elution time drift of all anions led me to realize that the analyst did not change the regeneration column on an ion chromatography instrument by following the recommendation. It could damage the instrument. There was a time that the small particles from aqueous sample were not filtered before introducing samples into a mercury analyzer. They blocked a t-valve along the route and flooded the sample route and detector. We had to change some accessories.

While I review the procedure, I found out that a reference was not located in a mentioned share area in the reference section of the document. The document index indicated that the reference was written in 2007. I sent an email to QA officers and the author with regard to this issue in the first place. The IT Service Desk confirmed that they could back up files 30 days old. There is no chance we can restore the document. The QA officers had no idea where the reference is located somewhere else. I talked with the author of the reference. He found the pdf copy in his computer, but there is no document index on it. There were many ways to get things done. It was my easy solution to assign a document index to the reference, and upload the reference to the company document system. The author of the procedure suggested attached the pdf as an appendix. I shared my thought to the author of the reference, but he insisted on looking for the hard copy with the document index on it first. Different ways showed that we were different. There is no I in team. I gave a bit of time to look for the hard copy. The section head, administrative assistants, QA officers, and record room staff were involved. It took about a couple of days and we still could not find the hard copy. At the end, I re-proposed my suggestion to the author of the procedure and the author of the reference.

People want to associate with leaders who have a positive personality and a sense of humor. When you are skilled at using humor, it increases trust and likeability. It builds, and sometimes even rescues, relationships. It clearly strengthens your leadership skills. As a significant fringe benefit, a sense of humor gives you a better-tuned humor radar.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of when I used the humorous touch in sending a letter to a fellow professional speaker. It illustrates keeping your humor radar tuned for fun opportunities. I enjoyed hearing Mary-Ellen Drummond, a terrific speaker and Toastmaster, give a presentation in Los Angeles. In her talk she mentioned that when she receives a great testimonial letter, she laminates it. When I returned home I wrote a nice letter and mailed it to her. When she received the envelope and opened it, she discovered that my letter was already laminated!\nYears later, I discovered that she was sharing my pre-laminated letter with an audience. When you create humor and share it, you never know how many people it will touch and to what extent it will build a relationship.\nHumor is also a terrific way to recover from a mistake. Less effective ways of dealing with a mistake includes ignoring or explaining it, or becoming defensive. Often, those choices can be awkward. Many times, when recognizing a mistake, laughter is clearly the best choice. Let me give you some examples.\nI received an e-mail inquiry for a speaking engagement on the East coast. At the end of my response to the request for information, I added: \u0026ldquo;I look forward to adding a special touch to your meeting in Deleware!\u0026rdquo;\nThe meeting planner replied to my e-mail with two simple words: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s DelAware.\u0026rdquo; I had misspelled the name of her state! I had replaced an A with an E.\nMy note back to her: \u0026ldquo;Thenks. Lern something every dey.\u0026rdquo;\nHer response (the capital letters are hers): \u0026ldquo;YOU PASS THE TEST! We needed someone with a TRUE sense of humor. Now I\u0026rsquo;m really excited. I\u0026rsquo;ll be in touch!\u0026rdquo;\nAnother example, again in communicating with a potential client, I misspelled the potential client\u0026rsquo;s first name. Instead of Cecelia I had written to her as Cecilia. Knowing that misspelling someone\u0026rsquo;s name is a tacky mistake, I quickly acknowledged the error before she had a chance to reply. I immediately sent her a second e-mail:\n\u0026ldquo;Oops, misspelled your name Cecelia. Sorry about that. Jhon.\u0026rdquo;\nMy way of acknowledging that I had unintentionally misspelled her name was to intentionally misspell mine. Her response was positive: \u0026ldquo;Funny – you are going to be great for us!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s another embarrassing mistake and a humor recovery. As a newly elected board member of an association, I received an e-mail from its president. \u0026ldquo;By the way John, did you know you keep calling me Rob when it\u0026rsquo;s Rod?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, as you probably know by now, my style is not to respond with a simple \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo;\nSince he had also asked three questions that required my response, I sent him the answers in three separate e-mails. The last one ended with: \u0026ldquo;PS: I sent you separate e-mails so I could practice your name.\u0026rdquo;\nHis response: \u0026ldquo;Thank you Jon, for practicing my name.\u0026rdquo; He intentionally misspelled my name! I assumed he did it intentionally because I know he has a fun sense of humor. One humorous reply deserves another. A few minutes later I sent him a limerick:\n There once was a man named Rod. For President he got the nod. He did a great job, but some called him Rob. Which struck him as kinda odd.\n Rod\u0026rsquo;s response: \u0026ldquo;Ho ho ho. Very clever. Funny too.\u0026rdquo; That entire humor exchange helped program Rod\u0026rsquo;s name into my brain. And since that time, I\u0026rsquo;ve used his name correctly.\nAnd then there was the time I accidentally broadcast an e-mail to people in 60 countries. I was helping a friend publish her first e-zine (electronic newsletter) issue. It appeared that it would be best to do the coaching over the phone. We were both signed onto the Internet, and I walked her through the steps on my e-zine server\u0026rsquo;s control panel while she took parallel steps on her control panel. Somehow I made the mistake of loading a blank e-zine into my server and sent it to 1000 of my subscribers. Oh no! I knew of someone who sent out an e-zine with a glaring error and received more than 200 subscription cancellations. I wanted to respond before my subscribers reacted. Humor to the rescue!\nIn less than an hour after I discovered the mistake, I sent out a special newsletter issue that read:\n\u0026ldquo;What do you do when you receive a blank e-zine? a. Be happy because you can read it quickly. b. Believe it is a do-it-yourself e-zine\u0026hellip;and write your own. c. Cancel your subscription. d. Keep your sense of humor.\n\u0026ldquo;It seems that a random blank issue from the Humor Power Tips computer-in-the-sky was sent to many of our subscribers. If you were half as surprised as I was\u0026hellip;then I was twice as surprised as you. Thanks for smiling with me.\u0026rdquo; And then I introduced a Blank Book Title Contest challenging people to write titles to imaginary blank books.\nThe response was very positive. The subscription cancellations were no more than they usually were, much less than one percent of my subscription base. Among the several positive comments about how I handled the mistake was one from Mick Court in Melbourne, Australia: \u0026ldquo;What a great follow-up to your blank e-zine. I found your lived example of responding to a technical mistake a really powerful lesson – how to use humor to recover ground after a technical mistake!\u0026rdquo;\nAs a bonus, I received more than 350 submissions for the Blank Book Title Contest. Here are ten of my favorites:\n The Greatest Story Never Told It\u0026rsquo;s Easy to Love Your Enemies – By George Bush and Michael Moore What I Learned in My Lifetime All By Myself How Logic Applies To the Understanding of Human Behavior Much Ado About Nothing The Sequel to The Last Word Gifts Greater Than Life 2021 Social Security Benefits Tricks to Teach Your Cat Best Short Stories Written in Invisible Ink\n It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that none of the fun and creativity of this group writing exercise would have happened without my choice of fixing a mistake with humor.\nBe alert for opportunities to use humor when dealing with mistakes or simply to put a memorable touch in your communications with others. You\u0026rsquo;ll make a lasting impression as someone who can see the lighter side of life. It will make you a stronger leader, a better speaker and it\u0026rsquo;s good for business!\nBy John_Kande\n Reference: Westside Toastmasters\n"},{"id":111,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/08-City-of-Calgary/Interview/04_beyond_job_requirements/","title":"Go Beyond Job Requirements","section":"Interview","content":"Question #15: Describe a time when you went beyond your job requirements?

I have done a couple of things which were beyond my primary responsibilities. First of all, I saw the need of streamlining data processing and data review. I went and took the training of VBA. I put data compiling, calibration curve equations, uncertainty calculation equations, and warning of data which are off the calibration curve into the programming codes. It saved us tones of time in data processing and review so that we could do more and we were not panic when we had extra things to do for laboratory audit. Secondly, I took the initiative to do administrative works, such as chemical consumable purchasing, and interacting with trades for lab maintenance, so that analysts can focus on their analysis and deliver results in a timely manner.

I turned off the pump, took off the guard column, put the column back on in the reverse order, selected the mobile phase B at a low flow rate, and turned on the pump to backwash the column for 30 minutes. The waste was collected in a weight boat. When it was finished, I turned off the pump and put a new guard column and the washed column on, remaining the disconnection to the mass spectrometer.

The goal was to transform the facility into a sample depot by maintaining the minimum analysis and ship most of the samples down to the Testmark facility in Sudbury, ON, as soon as possible. I was promoted to laboratory manager to lead the team through the transition process.\nThe first challenge was to reform the team and reorganize the activities. The number of staff was downsized from 10 to 3. Here is what I did:\n I redeployed one staff from lab operation to customer service. The new job made the staff motivated I hired seasonal workers to cope with the high volume of samples. Besides routine analysis, sample shipment became the top priority - samples were sent out the same day we received them. We needed to log in samples, confirm sampling requirements, make sub-samples, and prepare documents before shipments. I had a meeting at the very beginning with three staff: one lab technician was responsible for microbiological tests, one lab technician was responsible for chemical tests, and another staff was responsible for customer service. I set up the expectations, laid out the workflow, listed to-do items, and opened the floor for discussion. At the end of the meeting, we came up with a plan, and everyone was clear about their tasks. I then summarized it with meeting minutes. During the routine, I followed up with them on a regular base and made adjustments accordingly. I always stayed late to ensure samples got sent down by Purolator or Greyhound bus. I asked the new owner for a monetary incentive to schedule staff for work on weekends. With the new owner\u0026rsquo;s approval, the staff coming to work on weekends for a couple of hours got the whole day\u0026rsquo;s pay.  The second challenge was to implement Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). We were requested to use it even though the new features were kept added to the LIMS. Here is what I did:\n I managed to train staff with patience understanding their frustration dealing with ongoing change. I coordinated with the vendor of LIMS to provide feedback and help to install new updates for glitches. I worked with the financial director to sort out financial features on the LIMS.  We got the transition done within about one year. I handed over the smooth lab operation to the new lab manager.\nLooking back, one thing I could do differently was to get collective input on planning and organizing for some situations. It was when I joined AECL that I started to do so. It could be a way to motivate staff and uplift team morale.\nContact: RZ\n"},{"id":117,"href":"/docs/03-Soft-Skills/01-Leadership/04_Persistence_change_failure/","title":"Persistence Can Change Failures","section":"Leadership","content":""},{"id":118,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/11-CGC-QA-2016/Interview/04_internal_audit/","title":"Internal Audits","section":"Interview","content":"Question 6: Why are Internal Audits conducted on the Quality Management System?\n Response:\nThe internal audits are required by section 8.2.2 of ISO 9001:2008, as well as section 4.14 of ISO 17025. ISO 17025 states clearly that the cycle for internal auditing should normally be completed in one year. CALA requires that internal audits be conducted on an annual basis. All aspects of the quality management system must be audited each year; however, it is not necessary to do an internal audit of every test method every year.\nThe basic premise behind ISO 9001:2008 is the “Plan, Do, Check, Act Cycle” (PDCA). The “Check” phase is represented by the Internal Audits of the Management System. The objective of internal audits is to document and identify:\n•\tconformance of the quality system to the governing documentation (company policies, quality manual, procedures, regulations and/or standards);\n•\tits effectiveness; and,\n•\thow the system fosters and conducts continual improvement.\nI personally found internal audits help us to be prepared for the coming external audits.

We\u0026rsquo;ve all sat through functions where the speaker is a John Cleese wannabe who hardly belongs on Monty Python\u0026rsquo;s Flying Circus. Not to suggest that public speaking must be a laugh fest, but injecting just the right joke at just the right moment into an address can really capture your audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and goodwill. Humor can also serve to sharpen your speech\u0026rsquo;s focus and maximize its impact.\nAs an experienced Off-Broadway musical comedy director, actress and writer, I\u0026rsquo;ve mastered many comic stage skills in my time. The great thing about such theatrical tricks is that they can be easily and seamlessly incorporated into virtually any speech or report you may be called on to give. Learning a few simple humor-oriented speaking tips can also calm those butterflies in your stomach and give you a sense of control over your presentation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get you comfy with comedy by reviewing some basics:\nFeel Free to be Funny\nA confident, relaxed attitude is the first thing you need to master. Yet the idea of trying to be funny in front of your colleagues probably makes you feel anything but relaxed. This is normal. Randy Farias is a seasoned stage actor who specializes in comic roles. He explains: \u0026ldquo;Everyone in the world is nervous in front of a large group of people. If you try to clamp down on nervousness, your focus becomes the nervousness instead of the subject you\u0026rsquo;re trying to present.\u0026rdquo;\nSo acknowledge that the thought of being funny gives you the jitters, then work to become calm and self-assured. It\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that you really can\u0026rsquo;t fail at being funny. Resolve that your goal is not to be so hilarious as to knock Mr. Bean out of show business. Instead, all you want to do is share a funny, positive moment with your audience. If they laugh along, terrific; if not, it isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the world. You deserve credit for trying to spread great vibes, no matter what!\nStill, if your sweat glands are going into overdrive as you take the podium, plan ahead. \u0026ldquo;Indulge in the energy created by nerves,\u0026rdquo; advises Farias. \u0026ldquo;If you stumble at first, comment on it and laugh at yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s honest! The audience will laugh with you, not at you.\u0026rdquo; Don\u0026rsquo;t apologize, but do share the humor in it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also very important to tap into your Toastmasters training. Memorize and try to relax by following these tried and tested Toastmasters tips:\n Focus on your message, not on the audience. Visualize yourself giving your speech. Realize that people want you to succeed.  What\u0026rsquo;s Your Humor Style?\nMany people assume they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t crack a joke because they feel they are not naturally funny. But the fact that you possess the ability to laugh is proof that you have the tools to be funny.\nEveryone has a sense of humor; what makes the world so interesting is the fact that everyone\u0026rsquo;s sense of humor is unique. Some folks laugh their heads off at slapstick skits while others chuckle at romantic comedies. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to identify your natural style of humor; just zone in on what kind of comedy you find truly funny. Chances are good that the type of stuff you laugh hardest at is the type of humor you\u0026rsquo;ll be most comfortable delivering.\nReally, it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of being yourself. Randy Farias agrees heartily with this. \u0026ldquo;Children are some of the best models for comedy,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t filter anything before they speak or act. They\u0026rsquo;re honest with how they feel, they show it, and that often makes children very, very funny. I try to take that same tack when performing comedy.\u0026rdquo;\nComedy works when it isn\u0026rsquo;t forced. So don\u0026rsquo;t try to imitate a slapstick comedian - or even your favorite speaker. Don\u0026rsquo;t practice funny faces into your mirror, or put on weird, silly voices. Plan to face your audience as yourself. When thinking about the kinds of jokes you might include within your speech, think anecdotes - everyday situations your entire audience can relate to. Simply tell a funny tale in your speech the same way you\u0026rsquo;d relate a funny story to a friend, and your humor style - be it absurd, ironic or acerbic - will shine through naturally, with no obvious effort.\nPlugging Humor into Your Material\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve identified the particulars of your humor, what specific process do you use to work it into your speech?\nStart by writing the body of your address, leaving out the jokes initially. Your overall message is more important than anything else. Think of the humor you want to insert as an accent to, not an aspect of, your main message.\nOnce your speech is factually complete, read it over carefully. Make note of sections that can benefit logically from a bit of levity. Once you find such a section, play around with a few options of how to highlight these points with humor.\n\u0026ldquo;Humor is a rubber sword - it allows you to make a point without drawing blood.\u0026rdquo;\n Mary Hirsch  If your speech revolves around specific work issues that everyone present is well-versed in, for instance, having a bit of fun with the given circumstances will probably go over very well. However, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely important, especially in a professional setting, not to employ controversial or offensive humor, which I guarantee will backfire on you. Never resort to using any humor that is racist or sexist in nature. And unless you perform stand-up comedy in an adult-only nightclub, refrain from using off-color or profane jokes as well.\nYour Toastmasters training stresses the importance of knowing your room and your audience. Researching what the audience demographic will be is invaluable when it comes to predicting what type of humor will work. Similarly, the Toastmasters concept of knowing your material will help you feel prepared. Write your jokes directly into the copy of your speech and practice, practice, practice! Memorizing your speech, jokes included, will help you deliver it most naturally, as will trying it out in advance in front of family and friends.\nShould You Use a Straight Man?\nJerry Lewis famously worked with comic foil Dean Martin in many classic movie comedies. But in a public-speaking situation, is it really advisable to employ someone else as a straight man for your humor?\nIn certain circumstances, it can work, but you must evaluate and set up such a scenario very carefully. My Off-Broadway show pulled up an audience member onstage and into the production every single show, and it always appeared funny and spontaneous. In reality, however, each person we used was a \u0026ldquo;plant\u0026rdquo; - usually a friend of a cast member who was asked ahead of time and given plenty of preparation. This ensured that the show ran smoothly.\nIf you have a funny idea you\u0026rsquo;d like to employ in your presentation using another person, follow our tried-and-true theatrical sleight-of-hand and use a plant. Don\u0026rsquo;t spring any improvised surprises on your cohort. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t do a 10-minute routine with this person - you\u0026rsquo;ll bore your audience, and the message will be lost. Just one short, well-placed joke will suffice.\nIf your speech is meant to honor or introduce someone who is present, you may be tempted to employ this person as your straight man. Will it work? It depends on the person. Is this individual stuffy and serious or fun-loving and spontaneous? If the latter description fits, then include him or her in the levity.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how you could do this: Say that a local political candidate has accepted an endorsement from your organization. Today a luncheon is being held to make his acceptance official, and your job is to introduce the candidate to your group and to the local media. Your written speech naturally highlights a long list of the candidate\u0026rsquo;s accomplishments. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that during his most recent public appearance, he sang the local college football fight song notably off-key. Chances are your candidate might want to make light of such a minor embarrassment, if given the chance. So, ask him in advance if you can poke some good-natured fun at him in your remarks. He\u0026rsquo;ll probably agree, as it could work to his advantage and defuse any bad publicity.\nSarcastic humor is a big mistake, however. The last thing you want to do is make fun of a person you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to respect. Always put yourself in the other person\u0026rsquo;s shoes. If you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like a particular joke to be told about you, then don\u0026rsquo;t tell it about someone else.\nPace Yourself\nThey say timing is everything, especially in terms of delivering jokes. How important is pacing the humor in your speech? How exactly do you employ the practice of good comic timing? Randy Farias boils it down: \u0026ldquo;Simply be honest with the situation,\u0026rdquo; he says. \u0026ldquo;Allow the moments or moment needed and make the correct reaction choice. There\u0026rsquo;s a saying that acting is not acting but reacting, which is never truer than in comedy. That\u0026rsquo;s where the timing resides - that moment of truthful processing.\u0026rdquo;\nYou can easily translate this smart philosophy to your speech. Take in your environment - listen to what your audience gives you - and react to it. This will give your speech a natural rhythm and the proper pacing. Give the audience time to laugh. But speak faster or with more spirit if you sense a lull in the crowd. Let the situation reveal itself to you, and follow its lead in regard to the timing of the humor you use within your speech.\nPoints to Remember\nHere are a few more hints that can help your humor work smoothly:\n Smile and make eye contact with various audience members. Don\u0026rsquo;t laugh at your own jokes. Avoid improvisation, unless you\u0026rsquo;re feeling very comfortable with how the speech is going. Customize your material. What works for one audience may not work for another. Know when to leave \u0026lsquo;em laughing. Don\u0026rsquo;t run on too long. Always leave your audience wanting more.  Enjoy how fun it is to be funny. Plus, use it as a learning tool. What jokes and delivery techniques worked best for you? Which didn\u0026rsquo;t? This type of information will pay off when it\u0026rsquo;s time to use humor in your next speech.\nBy Lisa Malcahy\n \n"},{"id":121,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/04-Sysmex/Forth-Interview/","title":"Fourth Interview","section":"Sysmex","content":"Fourth Interview #  Date:\nInterview panel:\n 2022-03-23\nPiero Amicone, Am\n  Interview Review #  "},{"id":122,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/05-NAIT/","title":"NAIT","section":"Interview Experience","content":"Reviews #  ) When I recalled Paolo\u0026rsquo;s introduction about this position in the first interview, he emphasized on \u0026ldquo;deep expertise in chemical characterization\u0026rdquo;.

She smiled wide and placed her hands over her heart. The victory Wednesday marked a remarkable climb back up an Olympic mountain that Jacobellis, now 36 and a seasoned veteran in this game, had every reason to detest.\nOr leave behind.\n“Some days, I really don’t like it,” she said. “Some days, it’s very stressful and aggravating and there\u0026rsquo;s anxiety through the roof. But when it all comes all together, it really makes it worth it.”\nIt only felt fitting that Jacobellis, a five-time Olympian who has been humbled aplenty at the Games, made a breakthrough for a U.S. team that, until she showed up, could not seem to get anything right. Hours before her win, over on the Alpine course, Mikaela Shiffrin skidded out in the slalom to make her 0 for 2 at the Olympics. That opened the door for Jacobellis to flip the script and make some history, too.\nShe won America\u0026rsquo;s first gold medal of the Beijing Olympics. She became the oldest U.S. woman to win a gold in Winter Games history. Also, the 16 years marked the longest gap between medals for any U.S. woman at the Winter Olympics.\nShiffrin\u0026rsquo;s struggles aren\u0026rsquo;t the only troubles the U.S. has had. Earlier in the week, two defending snowboard champions, Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson, failed to medal in slopestyle. Anderson took to social media and conceded her “mental health and clarity just hasn\u0026rsquo;t been on par.”\nJacobellis made her mistake when she was 20, back in a time when the mental health of Olympians wasn\u0026rsquo;t much on the minds of media or anyone in the sports space.\nOn that day in Italy, she was far in the clear in the gold-medal race, but she bent her legs up and grabbed her board and gave a flashy little twist toward the grandstand. A method grab. It was a showy move saved for winning runs in a game where style trumps almost everything.\nBut Jacobellis fell.\nA hot-dogger and a showoff, some critics labeled her. Got what she deserved, others said.\nThe woman who had come into those Olympics as the quintessential star-in-the-making left as something else. Every four years when the Games returned, the story was reheated and retold. Jacobellis made one final over those three Olympics. Never got back on the podium.\n“I so vividly remember her little method off the jump and watching that gold medal slip out her fingers,” Aussie rider Belle Brockhoff said. \u0026ldquo;She’s copped so much (expletive) from the media and everything. For her to keep coming at it and not giving up is pretty inspirational.”\nThe Olympics are only a small part of the game for snowboard racers. Since 2007, Jacobellis has amassed 23 World Cup victories and 45 podiums and has become a towering presence in her sport. Not surprisingly, this was a popular victory with the riders.\n“She was already an example when I was young,” said the silver medalist, 27-year-old Chloe Trespeuch of France. “I’m so happy for her. Even if my goal was also the gold, she really deserved it. She has been here for a very long time.”\nIn snowboardcross, riders race in packs of four down 15 football fields' worth of curves, “rollers” and jumps. Speed is important. Strategy and patience come in handy, too. In her final two races, Jacobellis got out to an early lead and held it — easier said than done in a sport where riders use the contours of the course to changes speeds and slingshot past the leaders.\nJacobellis approached the final jump — where things unraveled in Italy — crouched low to the ground and racing hard all the way. She stayed in her crouch past the finish line. She was not thinking about Turin.\n“I definitely have put 2006 in the past,” Jacobellis said. “And I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of soul searching to realize that that one doesn\u0026rsquo;t define me as an athlete.”\nSo, instead of the “Lindsey Leap,” Jacobellis might now be known for hanging in there long enough to rewrite her story. It is now the story of a great comeback.\nOne lesson she wants athletes younger than her to take from her experience is \u0026ldquo;if you’ve made it to this stage, you’re a winner. And look at what you’ve learned from the experience, and take that with you later in life.”\nAnd what should the rest of the world take from a tale like hers?\n“Don\u0026rsquo;t count the old girl out,” she said.\n"},{"id":126,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/11-CGC-QA-2016/Interview/05_good_quality_indicators/","title":"Key Indicators for Successful Quality","section":"Interview","content":"Question 7: Describe the key indicators for successfully maintaining the quality control system in ISO 17025 accredited laboratory?\n Response:\n•\tThe laboratory analysts are trained and proficient on assigned analysis.

(maximum 300 words)\n Response:\nHow I communicate with my intended audience plays a bigger role than what I communicate about. It is about how the audience process the complex information. It is a nature of a technical person to try to communicate the complex information at one time. Although all of information is importance, not everyone could digest all information at one time. When necessary, I will break the presentation into a couple of sessions. I will present a couple of key points with supported information in each session. It is a trick to control the presentation time. I found the audience can easily lost focus after 45 minutes.\nIt is a nature of a technical person to present the complex information as detail as possible. I incline to share everything to the audience; I tend to have the audience enjoy my works as much I did. Everything has its value from my perspective. However, it is a challenge that what information the audience could take away from a presentation. I have to face this challenge by rethinking about what makes my presentation interesting to the audience. I would present summarized information in a concise way. Some of assisted tools can be used, such as charts, animated graphs. Body language is another important component, such as gesture, movement, and tone.\nIt is a nature of a technical person to think the audience is as smart as me and believe them can figure out on their own. The presentation usually is a one-way communication. However interaction could help me to understand whether the audience is following me. I would throw questions to the audience during the presentation. It is a learning curve to master how to present complex information to the audience. I am learning and practicing such skills in Toastmasters.\n"},{"id":128,"href":"/docs/04-Humorous-anecdotes-N-quotes/02-Humorous-anecdotes/03-Messages/06_add_humor_to_speech/","title":"How to Add Humor to Any Speech","section":"Toastmasters","content":"Learn how to make people laugh. You\u0026rsquo;ll have more fun, and the listeners will too!\nListeners appreciate a little humor, even in a serious speech. Done incorrectly, humor can be a disaster. Executed correctly, humor lightens the load, eases the burden and releases tension. There are three basic methods for adding humor to a speech: Tell a canned joke, tell an original joke or simply make a wry observation.\nMethod #1: Canned Jokes\nThe beauty of a canned joke is that it has usually withstood the test of time. For someone just starting to add humor, this is the best technique. By telling an old standby, you can concentrate on timing and delivery - two of the major keys to being funny.\nTiming and Delivery:\nThis refers to the way you present a joke. These two ideas may be the most important aspects of humor. As Toastmasters, we know that communication is more than just words. When you deliver a joke, your attitude alone can make or break the punch line.\nBut you have to get over the idea that you have to be perfect. Your audience wants you to succeed, and they want to laugh.\nOne of our newer members served as Toastmaster for the first time. She opened with a joke, stumbling through it. Even though she had to read the joke and even apologized to us ahead of time for her lack of experience, she told the joke with a smile and a wink. We laughed!\nAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears.\u0026quot;\nAudacity and an air of confidence can overcome your worst fears. Just say to yourself, \u0026ldquo;Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified. I might botch the punch line, I might forget the entire joke; maybe no one will laugh. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it anyway. It will be hard this first time, but easier the next and the next and the next.\u0026rdquo;\nThe basic keys to adding humor to your speech are:\n relevance, and unexpected insight  Let\u0026rsquo;s say you were doing a talk about ESPN or sports fanatics or even just sports in general. You might try the following \u0026ldquo;used\u0026rdquo; joke:\n\u0026ldquo;A sports-buff showed up at the sold-out football game. He took his seat on the 50-yard line and then gently placed a woman\u0026rsquo;s coat and an extra ticket on the seat next to him. The spectator behind him asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you saving that seat for someone?\u0026quot;\nThe man said, \u0026ldquo;No. It would have been for my wife, but she\u0026rsquo;s passed on.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry to hear that,\u0026rdquo; the spectator said. Then he added, \u0026ldquo;Gosh, why didn\u0026rsquo;t you give that extra ticket to a friend?\u0026quot;\nThe man turned around with a surprised look on his face and said, \u0026ldquo;All my friends are at the funeral.\u0026quot;\nThis joke is obviously relevant to a sports-oriented talk. It sets the theme of the speech and warms up the audience.\nThe insight is that we sometimes get so wrapped up in our own stuff that we forget about other people. We all do it. This guy just did it bigger and that makes it funny.\nTry out this joke (or any other) on several friends. Practice timing the punch line. Try different wording to make it your own. Try out different pacing, pausing in various places for emphasis. Like any other skill, you learn to tell a joke by practicing. Most people who claim they don\u0026rsquo;t know any jokes are simply saying that they haven\u0026rsquo;t practiced any.\nMost canned jokes are generic and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to attribute your source. However, if you are relating something specific to a certain comedian, you should give proper credit. Use your best judgment. You may want to say something like, \u0026ldquo;As Steve Martin so aptly put it: \u0026lsquo;The new phone book is here! The new phone book is here!'\u0026rdquo; But don\u0026rsquo;t start your joke with \u0026ldquo;I got this off the Internet\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Just launch into it.\nOnce you become comfortable telling jokes you\u0026rsquo;ve found from other sources, take your humor up a notch by trying out some original material.\nMethod #2: New Material #  There is a basic three-point structure you can follow to create your own, original material:\n Come up with a topic, Add a premise, and Turn it around.  Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works: First, come up with a topic. For example, if you are a parent, you might want to make a joke about being a father or a mother. Here\u0026rsquo;s a caveat. If you are a woman, don\u0026rsquo;t choose the topic of being a father. The audience won\u0026rsquo;t be able to relate through you.\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u0026rsquo;s eye. That\u0026rsquo;s enough.\u0026rdquo;\nNext, create a premise. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are making a joke about being a dad. Your premise might be that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to be a dad. Or, that having kids makes men a bit stupid. Or weird. Or that having kids is scary.\nComedy trainer Judy Carter uses those four specific words when she is training people to be funny. She calls them \u0026ldquo;attitude\u0026rdquo; words. When you are just beginning to experiment with writing your own material, it is best to stick with the basics:\n Algebra homework is hard. Skateboarding on the highway is stupid. Being a dad is weird. Being tall around toddlers is scary.  The third part is the hard part. You have to bring in the unexpected. For instance, if you are working with \u0026ldquo;skateboarding on the highway is stupid,\u0026rdquo; and you were being serious, you might finish with how dangerous it is. For a joke, look for insight. Look for pain.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a concrete example:\n Step one: Choose a topic. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you chose \u0026ldquo;parenting.\u0026rdquo; Step two: Choose an attitude. For example, \u0026ldquo;raising kids is hard.\u0026rdquo; Step three:\u0026lt; Create a twist. First of all, what is hard about raising kids?  Maybe your answer is that you have to be more mature.\nNow, think of a way to twist that around to surprise the audience. Here is how I used this topic to open my speech on traveling.\n\u0026ldquo;Traveling with kids is hard! You gotta be tough, you know?\nWe just got back from Disney World. We spent all day walking and it was hot and it was like, \u0026lsquo;I need a drink of water, and \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m tired,\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;I need to go potty.'\nFinally, my six-year old put her hands on her hips and said, \u0026lsquo;Dad, quit whining.'\u0026quot;\n*Timing and Delivery, Part II. Practice makes perfect. Although great material always sounds like it is impromptu, it rarely is. With jokes, more than with anything else, practice is imperative. You have to practice until it sounds as if you are just making it up on the spot.\nRecord your joke delivery and then listen. After a while, you will get a good feel for the pace. You will hear where the pauses work and where they don\u0026rsquo;t. Along the way, you\u0026rsquo;ll memorize the joke. It will also stop sounding funny to you. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry; your audience has never heard it.\nIn my travelogue about Florida, I tell a story about my five-year old.\n\u0026ldquo;Kids are wise, aren\u0026rsquo;t they? My five-year old son played in the sprinklers at the park and on the ride back to our condo, he took off all his clothes. He got out of the car and everyone stared at him as he walked down the street, naked as can be. JoAnn and I were mortified, of course, but he just looked around and said, \u0026lsquo;Well, at least I\u0026rsquo;m wearing sun block!'\u0026quot;\nThis story stopped being funny to me a long time ago, but whenever I tell it, everyone guffaws.\nThe Rule of Three\nThree is an inherently funny number. Just make a list of three things. Throw out the last one and replace it with something outlandish. A word, a phrase. A dead fish.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the simple topic of sun block and play it out.\n\u0026ldquo;Sun block is weird. (notice the attitude word) My wife packs SPF 44. Sun protection factor 44. Do you know what that means? That means that we can stay out in the sun 44 times longer with it on. Where are we going anyway? The Mojave Desert? The Sahara? The planet Mercury?\u0026quot;\nActing Out\nTake your humor up another notch\u0026hellip;act it out. Now take your rant against sun block and play it out even further:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you ever noticed that the companies that make sun block make bug repellent too? You have to have both because they make the sun block smell like Pina Coladas. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s going to attract bugs. They\u0026rsquo;re like \u0026lsquo;Yeah baby! It\u0026rsquo;s cocktail hour!'\u0026quot;\nSurviving the Joke\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve practiced your jokes and bounced them off the right people ahead of time, you\u0026rsquo;re sure to get some laughs. Even so, the day will come when the audience just doesn\u0026rsquo;t get it. There are two ways to deal with the \u0026ldquo;bomb:\u0026rdquo;\nOne is the \u0026ldquo;saver.\u0026rdquo; Powerhouse speaker J.R. Ridinger sometimes gets going so fast and furious that he leaves the audience behind. His favorite saver: \u0026ldquo;Maybe that one will catch you on the way home.\u0026rdquo;\nThe other technique is to just keep on keeping on. One of my all-time favorite inspirational speakers once gave a sermon on sex. The funny quotes she told at the beginning left the audience speechless. She handled her choice of material like a true professional, never missing a beat, though I squirmed and turned a bit red.\nListening to this professional also showed me how confidence and audacity can pull off a joke that a less confident person could never get away with.\nMethod #3: Wry Observations\n Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.\n Mark Twain   One of the great masters of the witty statements, Mark Twain once said that electric lights were to humor as lightning was to wit. In other words, unlike a joke that has a story-line, natural wit usually comes out as a pointed, wry observation.\nUse the triple-A method to develop your ability to make witty statements. First, be Aware, then add Attitude and Allow yourself to grow.\nBe aware by understanding that humor comes from understanding shared experiences, especially painful ones. In order to fully cultivate your own sense of humor, you have to stop seeing your life as completely tragic. We all have troubles. Open your eyes and your mind and watch for the irony and the contrast in life.\nYour attitude will help you be funny. Watch any great comedian, male or female. Some are gutsy and loud, some are meek and shy. You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to develop an attitude that fits you and then you have to let it shine.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, allow yourself to be funny. Open your mouth and try. Toastmasters is the perfect place to nurture your inner comic. Occasionally you may tell a stinker. Get over it and try again. Progress only comes with practice in front of real people.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to elicit a roar of laughter from your audience. Sometimes a witty observation will produce no more than a smile or a twinkle in someone\u0026rsquo;s eye.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s enough.\nRemember that Toastmasters is a learning organization. Give yourself permission to try, and trust that your fellow members are either (a) wishing they were as brave as you and respecting you for it, (b) about in the same place on the progress curve as you are and respecting you for it, or (c) re-living the time they first tried humor and respecting you for doing the same.\nNow, get out there. Be yourself, be happy and be confident. Long after your listeners have forgotten the content of your speech, they will still remember how you made them feel.\nBy Joe_Cooke\nTools for Comics\nShare your favorite joke with other speakers by posting it to www.breakingthefunnybone.blogspot.com and check out the following bonus links:\n For an audio example of a re-worked version of the \u0026ldquo;Traveling with kids is hard\u0026rdquo; joke, follow the \u0026ldquo;Quit whining\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; link.

The laboratory may be subject to suspension.\n•\tThe laboratory who has failed to comply with relevant terms and conditions of accreditation, including payment of applicable fees may result in suspension and/or withdrawal of accreditation.\n•\tSCC assessment teams have identified one, or a number of major non-conformities, or if a laboratory has declined a surveillance activity by SCC, or, when a laboratory brings the accreditation body into disrepute, or, when a customer has been charged with a criminal offense.\n•\tThe laboratory voluntarily suspense or withdraw all or part of its accreditation.\nFor the laboratory which was accredited by CALA, the following scenarios could result in temporary or permanent non-renewal of ISO 17025 accreditation.\n•\tif a laboratory fails to respond to requests for information related to non-conformances identified on an assessment report;\n•\tupon expiration of the accreditation certificate;\n•\ta laboratory fails to comply with the terms and conditions of accreditation;\n•\ta laboratory fails to submit a satisfactory response or additional information required to complete a response within the timeframe pre-determined by CALA, as communicated to the laboratory; or,\n•\tCALA receives substantiated information on the lack of validity of a test method.\n•\tif a laboratory fails to pay all fees that are owed to CALA.\nThe accreditation of a specific analysis method can be suspended or withdrawn in the following scenarios.\n•\tif a laboratory fails two or three successive PT studies for a specific analyte;\n•\tif a laboratory fails to submit a satisfactory PT corrective action report within the specified timeframe;\nIn severe cases of non-compliance, the Accreditation Council may immediately suspend or withdraw the accreditation, in whole or in part. Such cases might involve, though may not be limited to:\n•\tfailure to comply with the requirements of the latest version of ISO/IEC 17025:2005; or\n•\tfailure to demonstrate competency in those tests for which accreditation has been granted; or\n•\tmisrepresentation of the laboratory’s accreditation status; or violation of the CALA Code of Ethics.\nThe laboratory can voluntarily relinquish its accreditation, either in whole or in part.\nAccreditation is deemed terminated if it is either withdrawn or voluntarily relinquished.\n"},{"id":133,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/10-CGC-Chemist-2016/Interview/06_overlook_mistake/","title":"Overlooked Mistakes","section":"Interview","content":"Q16\tSometimes, it we rush, we can make mistake or overlook a mistake.

It builds bonds and refreshes the mind. And although the right words can make people laugh, humor is more than just words. As speakers, we learn that the impact of humor is heightened by how you say it, what you do when you say it, and how you use silence\u0026hellip;the pause. The pause adds punch to the punchline!\nOne of the reasons the pause strengthens your laugh lines is that it builds tension. There is a relationship between tension and laughter. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to use comic timing when you understand that relationship. So let\u0026rsquo;s examine the link.\nMany humor texts tell us that laughter is a natural stress reliever because when we laugh, muscle tension melts away. It\u0026rsquo;s an involuntary reflex - when we laugh our muscles automatically relax.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s said that even in war time, laughter is used to relieve tension. After a bomb explodes nearby and the dust settles, soldiers in a foxhole sometimes break out laughing. It\u0026rsquo;s one of nature\u0026rsquo;s ways of relieving the stress - a safety valve.\nThe Pause Releases Stress - Naturally\nSeveral years ago I witnessed this safety valve in action. Two women were driving on a San Diego freeway directly in front of me during rush-hour traffic. Traveling at about 50 miles per hour on the rain-slicked freeway, a car to their right swerved into their lane. The driver in front of me jerked the wheel, causing the car to spin around, and around and around - three and a half times! It never left the lane and it never hit another car. The women\u0026rsquo;s car and all the other cars on the freeway came to a dead stop. But their car was facing the wrong direction - we were hood-to-hood! As I looked both women in the eyes, we all burst into uncontrollable laughter. It\u0026rsquo;s clear that there is a definite relationship between tension, laughter and release of tension.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at how the pause relates to the tension principle in delivering your humor. To begin with, if you\u0026rsquo;re deliberately building tension, which will climax in laughter, a pause will heighten the tension and make the laughter more intense. For example, the late Sid Lorraine, often called the Dean of Canadian Magicians, employed the tension principle to get laughs. Once while performing at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, he was presenting a \u0026ldquo;pitchman act,\u0026rdquo; playing the role of a \u0026ldquo;snake- oil\u0026rdquo; salesman from the wild west. His voice started to crack. The longer he spoke, the worse his voice became, until he could no longer speak - silence! Most people in the audience were thinking \u0026ldquo;Somebody please give the poor man a glass of water!\u0026rdquo; He then took a drink of his \u0026ldquo;medicine\u0026rdquo; and immediately began talking full-throttle! He had caught the audience by surprise, built the tension, ex-tended and strengthened it with a pause, and then reaped the comic\u0026rsquo;s reward - laughter.\nYears ago, when entertaining a military group in Alabama, I used the \u0026ldquo;answer man\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Carnack\u0026rdquo; technique made famous by Steve Allen and Johnny Carson. This is where the entertainer holds an envelope to his head, gives the answer, and then opens the envelope and reads the question. I decided to build some tension en-route to the laughter.\nFirst came the set-up. \u0026ldquo;The answer is Oscar Meyer, Ball Park and a fighter pilot.\u0026rdquo; After opening the envelope, I said, \u0026ldquo;And the question is\u0026hellip;name three hot dogs!\u0026rdquo; By itself, this was a fairly funny line for a group of Air Force officers, some of whom were fighter pilots. But I used it primarily for setting up the joke to follow.\nHolding the next envelope to my head, I said, \u0026ldquo;The answer is\u0026hellip;Oscar Meyer, Ball Park and General Willis.\u0026rdquo; Pause! The tension built to an audible gasp, people thinking \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s going to call the General a hot dog!\u0026rdquo; This especially got a strong reaction because their new commander, General Frank Willis, had taken command only three weeks earlier. Opening the envelope, I said, \u0026ldquo;And the question is (pause) name three franks!\u0026rdquo; Pause. Tremendous laughter (and relief) filled the room. I built the tension, used the pause to enhance the tension before the punchline, and then used the pause again to let the punchline sink in.\nThe Pause Adds Punch To Punchline\nOf course there are times when tension is not built through words or a story line. Even then, a pause can strengthen the punchline. When used before the punchline, a pause sets up the anticipation of \u0026ldquo;here comes the funny stuff!\u0026rdquo; Anticipation is a form of tension. The impact of the punchline is enhanced by adding a tension relief.\nThe pause plays another important role when used just before the punchline. The most important part of the joke is the punchline and more specifically the punchword. The pause focuses attention on this key element. The well-placed and timed pause will help ensure that the audience hears the punchline.\nThe pause also lets people laugh. Years ago, a Toastmaster friend commented, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve figured out why you\u0026rsquo;re so funny\u0026hellip;you insist that we laugh!\u0026rdquo; She meant that a confident speaker delivers the punchline and pauses for the laughter because he or she knows it will follow. Novices often deliver the punchline and then nervously race on if the laughter doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately follow. So dare to be quiet, allow the audience enough time to respond and your humor will hit the mark.\nWe also use the pause to let our listeners enjoy the laughter to its fullest. Don\u0026rsquo;t step on the laughs by interrupting the laughter while it\u0026rsquo;s building. And don\u0026rsquo;t wait until the laughter has totally ended to resume speaking. An audio tape of your presentation will tell you if you\u0026rsquo;re discouraging laughter by resuming your talk too soon.\nAdditionally, you can magnify a funny line by using the pause to accentuate your physical delivery. For example, you might raise your eyebrows. Sometimes the pause can be used to do a \u0026ldquo;take\u0026rdquo; - a physical reaction to the situation. Johnny Carson and Jack Benny were masters of a slow take or glance to the right or left to make a line even funnier. Some stand-up comics pause to extend the laughter by making a slow, sweeping eye contact with the audience, from one side of the room to the other.\nYes, silence adds power to the punchline because it heightens the tension. A brief pause gives the audience time to recognize the humor and then react to it. And it draws attention to your physical delivery. So use silence to strengthen your humor and lift laughter to new levels!\nBy John Kande\n"},{"id":135,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/07-CGC-Senior-Tech/Interview/07_gather_info/","title":"Gather Information","section":"Interview","content":"Q: 7.

I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.\nThe experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable. What did we do? A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps. Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis. I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step. Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol.\nWe did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further. It was the risk.\nMy team lead and I decided to take a chance.

Beowulf is agood leader because he shows bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people in spite of the dangers hefaces throughout the poem. In the story, Beowulf knew that his people needed a leader and that hewas the only one who could save them.\nLeadership in Beowulf\nTo be labeled a good leader, a person must exhibit bravery. At the beginning of the poem, Beowulf and fourteen of his men sailed to Denmark to rid the kingdom of an evil monster named Grendel, a descendant from Cain. Beowulf had heard many stories about how Grendel killed all of King Hrothgars men. Beowulf travels to Denmark because he wants to fight Grendel to test his bravery and to save the kingdom. He knew that he would be the only one in the land with enough courage to battle the enemy. After killing Grendel in the mead hall, Beowulf was honored by hundreds ofpeople in the kingdom for being their brave hero. Beowulf was able to be victorious over Grendel because he did not let his fear of failure stop him from saving the lives of many people (Leadership in Literature)\nAnother quality of a good leader is someone who is honorable. An honorable person is someone who is noble, trustworthy, and ethical. Before leaving for his fight with Grendel, Beowulf throws away his sword and armor so the fight would be fair, since Grendel has no idea of the arts of war, or shield or sword play (681-682).\nBeowulf states that he would find no satisfaction in beating Grendel unless the fight was completely fair, which meant he would have to fight the monster bare-handed. Beowulf shows his true character in this scene of the poem because only the most honorable of men would risk his life so that no person had the greater advantage over the other. Grendel, on the other hand, shows his moral inferiority once he attacks Beowulf and his men in their sleep. Beowulfs honorable heart is rewarded at the end of this battle by being able to defeat his unworthy foe (Brave New World).\nLoyalty is one of the most paramount qualities of a great leader. A good leader must be trustworthy, leaving his/her people without a hint of doubt that they will not be let down. After the tragic death of the young King Heardred, the kingdom was in dire need of a new leader. This was when Beowulf steps in. Not only does Beowulf rule the Geats, but he did so for over fifty years. During his time as king, Beowulf fought in two more treacherous battles, allied with the Danes, and brought the kingdom significant amount of riches. Beowulf was a devoted leader to his people and showed his loyalty to them by his courageous heart and wise mind. The Danes not only praised Beowulf for being a fearless warrior but also for being the loyal ruler they needed so gravely for their kingdoms sake (Brave New World).\nA leader is someone who serves the people they lead. Beowulf recognized the desperate need for a leader and he knew he was the only one suited for the task at hand. Beowulf makes a good leader because he exhibits great amounts of bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people. Beowulf selflessly risked his life multiple times for the sake of the Geats. Beowulfs exceptional leadership qualities of bravery, honor, and loyalty will be remembered by readers for years and years to come.\n"},{"id":139,"href":"/docs/04-Humorous-anecdotes-N-quotes/02-Humorous-anecdotes/03-Messages/08_tell_jokes/","title":"How To Tell Jokes","section":"Toastmasters","content":"Are you one of those people who always complain, \u0026ldquo;I just can\u0026rsquo;t tell a joke\u0026rdquo;? Sometimes we tell ourselves this, but it is not necessarily true. Being good at telling jokes doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to be a comedian. What it requires is a better understanding of some basics of telling jokes and a little practice. Once you familiarize yourself with these basics, your joke-telling skills will improve.\nThe four basic rules of jokes are timing, rhythm, rule of threes, and material. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each separately.\nTIMING, for our discussion, has two functions:\n  The first has to do with the timing of telling the joke. Think of a joke as a miniature story. To tell your story, you will want your listeners' undivided attention. When a joke fails, the reason may not be that the joke isn\u0026rsquo;t funny; it may be caused by bad timing by the person telling it. An example of this would be telling a joke at a funeral. It has been done, but the timing is inappropriate. Another example is substituting jokes for compassionate listening to a troubled friend. As obvious as this seems, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing how often we ignore this common-sense rule.\n  The second function of timing relates to the internal workings of the joke itself. To better understand this, visualize the person telling the joke as an art instructor. Her student is the listener. As the instructor begins her joke, the student will start painting a picture on the canvas of his imagination. The words used in telling the joke will provide instructions as to what the student is to paint. If the joke begins with, \u0026ldquo;Two men went into a bar \u0026hellip; ,\u0026rdquo; it has to be timed to allow the student to mentally paint those two men going into that bar.\n  This part of the joke is called the setup. The better the timing during the setup, the greater the probability of a payoff on the punchline. A major reason beginners have trouble telling jokes is that they fail to do the setup properly. They may mutter the words or rush through this crucial stage of the joke. Without proper timing for the setup, most jokes will fail because they simply will not make sense.\nBeginners often also are too wordy or they omit important descriptive details. Avoid both extremes! Was it \u0026ldquo;two men went into a bar\u0026rdquo;? Or was it \u0026ldquo;a tall man with a black beard and a little short guy with a big belly\u0026rdquo;? Be more specific and paint a vivid picture.\nRHYTHM, like timing, has two points of interest: Individual joke rhythm and sessions rhythms.\nIndividual jokes are our favorite jokes that we tell repeatedly, giving them a \u0026ldquo;personal rhythm.\u0026rdquo; The more we tell these jokes and polish their wording, the more refined that rhythm becomes. A joke\u0026rsquo;s rhythm is measured not so much by the words we use as by the timing of its delivery. Some jokes, if written out, may appear long. But when they are told, they are rhythmically short. Sessions rhythms develop during successful joke-telling sessions; that is when two or more people are engaged in swapping jokes. The sessions rhythms develop when the jokes being told are of similar \u0026ldquo;individual\u0026rdquo; rhythms.\nIf during a session we introduce a joke of a longer rhythm, we will interrupt the session\u0026rsquo;s rhythm, and the joke probably will not get a good response. The following example will make this point clear:\nThink back to the last time you were in a good joke-telling session. The jokes were great, the laughter was contagious and the adrenaline was flowing. Then someone started telling a joke that seemed to take forever (longer rhythm). As this person plowed through a lengthy setup, several things happened in rapid succession. Laughter died out, participants lost focus and everyone seemed uncomfortable. The problem? The joke simply did not match the rhythm of the joke-telling session. It is usually in a situation like this that the person who interrupts the rhythm decides that he or she just cannot tell jokes.\nHad this person been aware of joke rhythms, he or she would have selected a story in the same rhythmical range. Then, even if it were not funny, it would have slipped by smoothly, and the session would have continued. So much for timing and rhythm.\nTHE RULE OF THREES is the third point necessary for successful joke-telling. This rule dictates that a joke\u0026rsquo;s punchline must occur on the third line of the joke. If it goes beyond the third line, the joke is too wordy and too long. (There is an exception to this rule: jokes known as one-liners.)\nThe reason: We are subconsciously trained to hearing a joke\u0026rsquo;s punchline on the third line. We intuitively expect the rule of threes to be operating when we listen to a joke.\nKeep this in mind while listening to someone tell a joke. You\u0026rsquo;ll be amazed at how often this formula is used. Violating this principle is probably the number one error of inexperienced joke tellers. They carry the joke far beyond the third line and lose any chance of the joke\u0026rsquo;s getting a good response.\nThe next time you hear a joke that fails to follow this rule, change the joke before you tell it. Drop some of those repetitions that take the joke beyond the rule of threes. Review your own jokes and note whether you have been violating this rule. Rewording your jokes is not hard, and your story characters will have a longer life.\nDuring television\u0026rsquo;s early days, a famous comedian wanted to prove the rule of threes to his staff. During the audience warm-up portions of his TV show, he opened with the usual monologue. Then, without notice, he deliberately started telling a nonsense story that sounded like a joke. On the third line of this ruse, the audience laughed exactly as if it were a real joke.\nMATERIAL is the fourth and final principle for telling good jokes. Material refers to the number of jokes in your repertoire. Analyzing your material should make you more aware of three distinctions that should put you ahead of most jokesters. It will make you more conscious of joke rhythms, and it will help you see that jokes fit particular subject categories. You will discover what categories you are strongest in and where you need additional material.\nBegin by classifying your jokes into rhythm and subject categories, starting with rhythm. Pick a favorite joke and say it into a tape recorder. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a recorder, then just say the joke aloud, keeping in mind that you are focusing on rhythm. After you have done this several times, do the same with another favorite. With the second joke, you have a comparison and should note a difference between the two jokes' rhythms. If your jokes are written on cards, note on the cards what you think their rhythms would be. Determine whether each joke\u0026rsquo;s rhythm is fast, slow or in between. You can create your own classifications. The point is to be aware of the different rhythms of each joke you tell.\nTurning to subject categories, use the same jokes you picked for your rhythm analysis and ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;What is this joke about? After you have answered your questions, assign the joke a category.\nOnce you have completed your inventory and analysis, it\u0026rsquo;s time to start expanding your joke categories to fit many situations. One good way to do this is to start paying close attention to jokes you hear. When you find a joke you like, write it down. Start telling the joke as soon and as often as you can. This is a way to practice, and the more you practice, the smoother your delivery will be.\nAlso evaluate jokes you are currently using. After telling a particular joke, ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Is this one working?\u0026rdquo; Be honest, and if it is, keep it. If it is not, drop it and try something else. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste time on dead material.\nWhat do you do if you hear a joke that makes you laugh but you would not want to repeat it? Laugh at it if it is funny; then forget it! In my experience, trying to separate certain jokes for certain situations gets fuzzy. Eventually, these same jokes will find their way into a session and could be embarrassing. Do not repeat them; let them go.\nAnother good idea is to start a joke file and categorize it. You can do this with 3-by-5 index cards or record the jokes on your computer. Even if you understand timing, rhythm and the rule of threes, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have adequate material, you will have nothing to draw from in a presentation or at a party.\nRemember the four basics and you\u0026rsquo;ll be on your way to a long, successful joke-telling career. You will be the life of the party, unless you hog the spotlight or laugh at your own joke.\nBy John_Schnauder\n"},{"id":140,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/01-CGC-Chemist_2022/01-Take-Home-Exam/08_Overcome_obstable_CGC_2022/","title":"Overcome Obstacle","section":"Take Home Exam","content":"EC5.2 Describe a situation at work when you had to overcome a significant obstacle in order to achieve an established goal.

They are, in short, places where you can flop and get away with it, and come back to fight another day.\nThe usual amount of stage time per performer is five to eight minutes, which, depending on how you\u0026rsquo;re doing up there, can be an instant or an eternity.\nThe difference between simply speaking to an audience and doing stand-up lies in the comedian\u0026rsquo;s ability to instantly form a connection with the audience and to elicit an utterly visceral response within seconds. It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to hold people\u0026rsquo;s interest; it\u0026rsquo;s quite another to persuade them to laugh. Again and again.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s funny? Thousands of books have been written on the subject and very smart people have ended up pounding their heads on their desks over that one. One man\u0026rsquo;s hilarity is another\u0026rsquo;s disgust. Bob Hope and Sam Kinison had legions of devoted fans, but neither man would ever try the other\u0026rsquo;s material. Ever. So let\u0026rsquo;s leave any discussion of what\u0026rsquo;s funny to academics and others who buy their aspirin by the trainload.\nInstead, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about a few tools the average public speaker can cull from the stand-up comedian\u0026rsquo;s bag of tricks.\nKnow Thyself #  While it may be possible to slip into a stage persona that is 180 degrees out of phase with your actual personality and still get a laugh or two, your audience will see through this quickly and begin to distrust you. The best material, seasoned comics will agree, comes from real life - your life. And your best presence on stage arises from your own distinct personality and unique experiences.\nA mantra among aspiring comedians is, \u0026ldquo;Trust your funny.\u0026rdquo; This means nothing more than believing that what you bring to the stage is worth listening to, and will ring true with an audience.\nThis self-trust can take time. \u0026ldquo;Your style is formed in childhood and you can\u0026rsquo;t escape it,\u0026rdquo; writes comedian and comedy coach Judy Carter in her book Stand-Up Comedy: The Book. \u0026ldquo;Your style will be revealed to you. It is a discovery of who you already are - what you are cut out to do. This process of discovery can happen overnight or, more likely, it can take months or years.\u0026rdquo;\nStudy the Good Ones #  Be an intellectual sponge. Watch successful comedians with an eye to their timing, their physical actions, their particular style, their vocal delivery. Before long, you\u0026rsquo;ll naturally gravitate toward a favorite or favorites. At that point, writes comedian and teacher Franklyn Ajaye in Comic Insights: The Art of Stand-Up Comedy, \u0026ldquo;zero in on the comedian or comedians whose sense of humor and style of comedy reminds you of the sense of humor you naturally display around your friends and associates when you are relaxed. When you find the comedian who reminds you of what you do naturally, that particular comedian can serve as a guide or influence.\u0026rdquo;\nUse Real Life #  \u0026ldquo;Where do you get your ideas?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a question comedians are asked all the time. The answer is simple: from their own lives and from observing the world around them. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to simply be an observer. Aspiring comedians must have an especially keen eye for the absurd and hilarious in daily life. They must see life through funny-colored glasses.\nJeff Jena, a successful comedian I once interviewed, said that most people who say they have a sense of humor are mistaken. \u0026ldquo;They have an appreciation of humor,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;They recognize a funny line when they hear it. But as a professional comedian I have a sense of humor. I\u0026rsquo;m able to mine the funny situations in the world around me.\u0026rdquo;\nPractice, Practice, Practice #  Some comedians practice in front of a mirror; others say that won\u0026rsquo;t work, that you need a live audience, even if it\u0026rsquo;s only one person. The bottom line is that practice is essential, and honing your material in a workout room is the best practice of all. There\u0026rsquo;s no substitute for stage time. Will the nerves ever go away? Nope. Will you gain confidence and presence? Absolutely.\nConfidence Is Everything #  Before one of my first sets in the local workout room, a veteran comedian advised me to \u0026ldquo;walk up on that stage like you owned it. Swagger. Strut. Jump up those three steps like you\u0026rsquo;re about to get handed a check for a million bucks. Look like you\u0026rsquo;re having the time of your life.\u0026rdquo;\nHe said that not just to boost my confidence, but to remind me that the previous few rookie comics had taken the stage as if they were ascending the gallows or boarding the Titanic. They were terrified, and it showed. And, as an audience, your heart goes out to them. But pity and laughs are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, if you vault into the spotlight like Tarzan, you can get away with a couple of jokes that bomb. The audience will trust that you\u0026rsquo;ll get it right the next time. And, amazingly, so will you.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re In the Driver\u0026rsquo;s Seat. So Drive! #  Judy Carter\u0026rsquo;s book Stand-Up Comedy makes reference to talent manager Buddy Mora, who discovered David Letterman, when she talks about being true to your own vision. She quotes Mora as saying, \u0026ldquo;You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t give an audience what they want. Give them what you want. Most comics will go down to the audience level to make it work, when in fact what you should be doing is bringing the audience to your level.\u0026rdquo;\nCarter goes on: \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s hard to swallow the idea that you can\u0026rsquo;t make everyone love you. This one\u0026rsquo;s worth repeating: You can\u0026rsquo;t and won\u0026rsquo;t be able to make everyone love you. You must go onstage with a passionate desire and the intent to communicate your thoughts and feelings, not just to make people laugh.\u0026rdquo;\nKnow Thy Audience #  I once witnessed (that\u0026rsquo;s the only word for it) a very skillful comedian perform at a black-tie cigar stag dinner at a posh country club. His act consisted, in large part, of edgy, countercultural, \u0026ldquo;stick-it-to-the-man\u0026rdquo; style material. His audience consisted, almost without exception, of uncommonly wealthy arch-conservative businessmen. The silence was deafening.\nYou need enough flexibility built into your presentation that you can shift gears and, for instance, cut any \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; bits out of your act when you\u0026rsquo;re working the mayor\u0026rsquo;s annual prayer breakfast.\nStart Big, End Bigger #  This is a nifty little trick that applies to speakers as well as comics. You want to get the audience laughing as quickly as possible, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to hit them with your Sunday punch in the first seconds of the first round. Start with your second-best bit. End with a killer.\nMake It Look Easy #  If you can make something so monumentally difficult as stand-up comedy look like duck soup, you can\u0026rsquo;t help but succeed. This means developing polish. Which means, again, practice and perform, practice and perform. If it looks to the audience like you just wandered in off the street to share a few yuks with them, if your act is so seamless that it appears you\u0026rsquo;re just talking off the top of your head, if you can stand up under those intensely bright lights and look out into that bottomless blackness and feel like you just settled into your own personal recliner chair, well\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not impossible. And the journey truly is energizing, both physically and creatively. Even if you only get up onstage two or three times, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a better and more confident speaker. It\u0026rsquo;s worth breaking a sweat.\nWant to give it a try?

Can\u0026rsquo;t you take a joke?\u0026rdquo; Do you ever feel guilty after laughing at a joke? Have you ever been an evaluator at a club meeting when the speaker used inappropriate humor?\nDo you wonder why I am asking these questions? These queries will help us focus on the most important question when it comes to using humor: To tell the difference between constructive and destructive humor, between humor that helps and humor that hurts, between laughing *with* others and laughing *at* others.\nHumor is a powerful tool. It can build up or cut down. Toastmasters need to look for ways to maximize the positive and to minimize the negative impacts of humor. You need to learn the difference between humor that works for you and humor that works against you as a speaker (and as a human being).\nTo develop an effective sense of humor, you need to develop sensitivity to humor. To accomplish this, try the following three steps:\n Draw the line between laughing with others and laughing at others. Interrupt toxic humor. Use humor that is nourishing.  Let\u0026rsquo;s take these steps one at a time. The more we can help ourselves and others be aware of the difference between positive and negative humor, the more intentional we can be in following Robin Williams' notion that humor is \u0026ldquo;acting out optimism.\u0026rdquo;\nLaughing At Others:\n Is based on contempt and insensitivity Destroys confidence through put-downs Excludes some people Is offensive, sarcastic and divisive Reinforces stereotypes Is slanderous Is cruel  Laughing With Others:\n Is based on caring and empathy Builds confidence Is inclusive - A person chooses to be the \u0026ldquo;butt\u0026rdquo; of a joke (as in \u0026ldquo;laughing at yourself\u0026rdquo;) Is amusing - invites people to laugh Is supportive Brings people closer Leads to positive repartee Pokes fun at universal human foibles Is nourishing Is an ice-breaker  Interrupting Negative Humor\nMy guess is that most people who use toxic humor are not trying to be malicious - they are just unaware that their humor is hurtful to others and ultimately to themselves. They often respond with, \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t you take a joke? I was only kidding.\u0026rdquo;\nRegardless of the person\u0026rsquo;s intent, this kind of humor hurts. We can all learn from the African proverb, \u0026ldquo;The ax forgets. The tree remembers.\u0026rdquo;\nSo how can we help those who use the ax, who use cutting humor, to become aware of what they are doing and to break this negative habit? We need to be assertive, supportive and firm - and take some risks. There is no single \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; way to respond to negative humor - it will really depend on the situation, the people involved, and the nature of the interaction.\nHere is a list of ways to interrupt an ethnic or put-down joke. The next time you hear toxic humor, try out this behavior and make note of the reactions (both in yourself and in the other person). The key is to move from awareness into action.\n *Use a quotation to give perspective. A fifth-grade teacher told me her students used negative humor on each other all the time. She intervened by putting up a quote on the board, \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to blow out my candle to make yours glow brighter.\u0026rdquo; She called the pattern to their attention, and the behavior stopped. Use an \u0026ldquo;I statement.\u0026quot; Comedian Bill Cosby says that when someone is about to tell an ethnic joke, he simply says, \u0026ldquo;I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear it.\u0026rdquo; Making an \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; statement (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t appreciate jokes like that\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I feel uncomfortable with ethnic jokes\u0026rdquo;) can be a powerful way to take responsibility for yourself and to let the other person know the impact of negative humor. Don\u0026rsquo;t respond. Without the reinforcement of laughter, the behavior may disappear by itself. Some people take this a step further by walking away from negative humor. Ask the negative joke-teller to explain the joke. This does two things simultaneously: (1) it kills the joke (whenever you have to explain humor, you analyze it to death) and (2) it helps the joke-teller to become more aware of what he or she is saying. An innocent request like this can be a very smart approach.  Of course, there are many more ways to tackle this situation. Feel free to add to this list\u0026hellip;and use the responses whenever appropriate.\nExample: The Only Way\nMany people who use negative humor just don\u0026rsquo;t know any better - or any alternative. Most of what they have seen, heard and experienced is toxic humor - humor used as a weapon rather than as a tool. It\u0026rsquo;s no wonder this is the style they adopt. As Albert Schweitzer noted, \u0026ldquo;Example is not the main thing in influencing others. It is the only thing.\u0026rdquo;\nWe need to help people see by our own behavior that humor doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be at someone else\u0026rsquo;s expense, that we can use humor to laugh at ourselves and not at others, and that humor can be used to heal rather than harm. We can remind them that humor is laughter made from pain, not pain inflicted by laughter.\nLook for ways to invite helpful humor into your life and work. Look before you lip. Laughing with others leaves people with whole self-esteem; laughing at others leaves people with a hole in their self-esteem.

Seek to reframe stressful situations into laughing matters by asking yourself, \u0026ldquo;What would my favorite comedian see or say if he or she were in my shoes?\u0026rdquo; Make your kitchen refrigerator into a humor bulletin board. Keep a variety of cartoons, fun quotes and photos that elicit a smile. Look for funny signs around town. One example is a doctor\u0026rsquo;s sign that reads: \u0026ldquo;Specializing in ear, nose and throat. Office in the rear.\u0026rdquo; Turn Sunday into \u0026ldquo;Funday\u0026rdquo; by creating a weekly dinner-table ritual with your family and friends. Everyone seated at the table shares a funny incident or situation that invited laughter that week. At work, hand out \u0026ldquo;va-va-voom vouchers,\u0026rdquo; which can be cashed in when needed. The vouchers can be good for anything from \u0026ldquo;a one liner\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;five minutes to help you with one of your tasks.\u0026rdquo; Send fun and unusual postcards to friends and relatives. At home, practice playful ways of entering a room. Find mischievous ways for you and your kids to jump out of a closet to greet your spouse upon arrival home. Watch old videotapes of family and friends. It\u0026rsquo;s a sure-fire way to laugh your way down memory lane.

Why you chose this example to demonstrate your competency in planning, organizing, and coordinating.\n The situation in the year 2015 at AECL demonstrated my ability to manage simultaneous work tasks and multiple people. Here were multiple tasks:\n Got testing results out. Many internal clients expected results. Led the revision of the Quality Manual because I was the author of the previous version. Stakeholders across the company were involved, including our section, my manager, QA officers at the local facility, QA officers at the branch level, senior QA officers at the cooperate level, and senior managers at the cooperate level. They expected to review it in the document management system. The accreditation agency expected it before arranging an audit. Routine tasks.  I have used these techniques and tools to manage the tasks.\n Coordination, engagement, and collaboration. I collaborated with a primary QA officer at the cooperate level to re-write the Quality Manual. I leveraged the primary QA officer\u0026rsquo;s influence to engage senior managers to approve the document in the document management system as quickly as possible. Plan and teamwork. Technologists organized and re-allocated workloads to tackle the multiple tasks. I monitored the progress. Improved operational efficiency proactively. I developed some computer programs in 2013 to process raw data and review data automatically. It saved my time from reviewing analysis results. Task organization. I set priorities for multiple tasks and used the Outlook calendar to manage my time and tasks.  I managed stakeholders' expectations by keeping them updated on progress and unexpected difficulties ahead of time and holding ourselves accountable.\nThe outcomes:\n We met the most expectations of clients for testing. We submitted the requested documents two weeks late with exemption to the accreditation body. They executed the audit on schedule. The external audit went successfully.  Evaluation of the quality of the outcomes: The section received the company-wide recognition award for successful re-accreditation. It demonstrated our commitment to maintaining the lab accreditation.\nWhat I would do differently next time: I could use different ways of engaging others to commit to assignments.\nWhat I would continue to do next time:\n I did not expect to get a company-wide recognition award. I feel my efforts were recognized, and it was an effective tool to motivate me to do the job. I will do the same thing to my team in future. I would continue to improve operational efficiency proactively.  The reason I chose this example:\n The project of re-writing the Quality Manual took a lot less time than an average document revision. I was able to manage multiple tasks and lead the project by planning, organizing, and coordinating stakeholders in different groups at different sites across the company.

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions #  There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins #  Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page #  The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File #  When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent #  Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter #  The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown #  Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files #  Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template #  A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template #  A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template #  A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it.

We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme #  Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton #  Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page.

It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely.

Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory #  When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates #  In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage #  The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts #  We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File #  $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates #  If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials #  In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials #  The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme/partials/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now \u0026ldquo;your title here\u0026rdquo;, which comes from the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.\nUpdate the Default Single Template to Use the Partials #  $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts #  It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template #  We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself #  DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"},{"id":152,"href":"/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/","title":"Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll","section":"Tags","content":"Move static content to static #  Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output.

A member responded: \u0026ldquo;We were asked if an ear grafted to the forehead was art. Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s called Forehead Art\u0026hellip;or F-ART. Which gives you my answer to whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s art.\u0026rdquo;\nOops. That joke crossed the invisible line separating appropriate humor from the inappropriate. Did I talk to the person who presented the joke? Well\u0026hellip;No. I thought it would look strange if I were talking to myself. After I delivered the punchline, I decided I should have crossed the joke off my list. I had other things to say and I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t need one more joke.\nBut once it leaves the lips, there\u0026rsquo;s no calling it back. Of course the joke wasn\u0026rsquo;t gross or obscene. I didn\u0026rsquo;t say the word; I only spelled it. The audience laughed. It\u0026rsquo;s not really a joke about bodily functions. It made a point in a subtle and light-hearted way. It had great humor structure; a solid joke followed with two toppers (punchlines riding on the wave of the first joke). I\u0026rsquo;m really good at rationalizing and justifying. Most of us are. If only I had asked the right question, it would have saved me from crossing the line.\nHere is the question that would have helped me self-censor that joke:\n\u0026ldquo;Would I use this joke if I were delivering it at a corporate event where I was paid a substantial fee as the guest speaker?\u0026rdquo; This is one litmus test I could use to arrive at a \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; answer for the forehead-art joke. Other relevant questions would disqualify the joke as well, but the \u0026ldquo;corporate test\u0026rdquo; is a good measure of appropriateness. Humor presented at a Toastmasters meeting should meet the professional mark of the corporate-test question.\nI learn by doing and by making mistakes. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a better place to stumble than at a Toastmasters meeting! When it comes to humor, the older I get, the more conservative I become. This growth and learning is not a function of age, it\u0026rsquo;s a result of experience. Let me share some lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned along the way. You\u0026rsquo;ll benefit because the best way to learn is from other people\u0026rsquo;s mistakes\u0026hellip;even if they\u0026rsquo;re mine.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at some critical questions. These will help guide you through the minefield of good and bad taste. Some questions lead you to making the right choice. Some questions take you down the wrong path.\n Are there humor danger zones? The riskiest areas for humor include sexual references, bodily functions, body parts and classic four-letter words. These should be off limits at any Toastmasters functions, including humorous speech contests. Danger zones also dance around humor in the areas of race, religion and politics. And let\u0026rsquo;s add gun control, gay marriage and doctor-assisted suicide. We could add more.  • Are there some audience members who just wait to have their hot buttons pushed? Yes. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s one of those red-flag words that will strike someone the wrong way. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s the listener\u0026rsquo;s personality that makes him or her easily offended. I received an e-mail from a Toastmaster who reads my newsletter. He said, \u0026ldquo;I was delivering a speech and I had the audience in a great state until I said the word \u0026lsquo;prostitution.'\u0026rdquo; Sometimes just one word will do it.\n• So what\u0026rsquo;s the problem? Here is the inner dialogue we have when we pose that question: \u0026ldquo;The joke wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad. People shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so sensitive. It was only a word. Only a person with issues would have been offended.\u0026rdquo; Just because you don\u0026rsquo;t have their issues, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it open season on disregarding other people\u0026rsquo;s sensitivities. As best you can, you need to be in touch with the yardstick the audience uses to measure good taste. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a line drawn in the sand - identifying it is more art than science.\n• How many people need to be offended for it to be too many? This question will not help you pin down the appropriateness of a joke. What if only one person was offended? Is that too many? What if the person offended is just waiting to be offended? There are some people who will always find something in your speech that is inappropriate\u0026hellip;because it\u0026rsquo;s their job. You could change your speech, but that won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be the answer for the one offended. I don\u0026rsquo;t lose sleep worrying about that rare person.\nOn the other hand, there are times when offending one person is definitely one too many. I attended a program, as an audience member, where a speaker handled sensitive humor very skillfully. With two speakers on the program, the first was a woman who talked about the challenges of being a large woman in a thin society. She was a very funny speaker and skillfully poked fun at herself. Near the end of her program she sang a song. The second speaker, referred to the women\u0026rsquo;s speech this way: \u0026ldquo;Her program was so wonderful, I never wanted it to end. I felt really bad when she started singing. Because as we all know, it\u0026rsquo;s over when the fat lady sings.\u0026rdquo; Then he added, \u0026ldquo;I asked her if it was OK to say that.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo things were involved here. First, he had the good sense to check with the other speaker to see if she was comfortable with the joke. Based on the humor in her speech, it was a good bet that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with his line. But it would have been a big mistake to assume that since she poked fun at herself, it would be okay for someone else to do it. Second, it let the audience know that the first speaker was \u0026ldquo;in on the joke\u0026rdquo; and not simply the butt of the joke. This helped make the joke more acceptable to the woman who was the subject of the joke. When a joke is coordinated with someone ahead of time, usually they love it even more because they feel they were part of the process that created the joke. To my knowledge, no one was offended.\nWho is the ultimate judge? I remember a regular performer at a comedy club in Montgomery, Alabama, where I often performed on Open-Mike Night in the early 1980s. One night, after a bad set, the comic confided in me: \u0026ldquo;The audience bombed!\u0026rdquo; Not exactly. Although he was normally funny, on that night, he bombed. Don\u0026rsquo;t be too fast to blame the audience. If a joke book falls open in the woods and nobody is there - is it funny? No. It takes an audience for something to be funny. And it takes an audience for something to be offensive. They\u0026rsquo;re also the primary judge of good taste. We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about a majority vote here. If only 10 percent of the audience thinks your humor is inappropriate, the judge and jury have spoken and you have a problem.\n• Did the audience laugh? This is never a measure of appropriateness of a joke. Surprisingly, it\u0026rsquo;s not even a measure of its comic value. An inappropriate joke can often get laughs simply for its shock value. One reason people laugh is to relieve tension. If a joke causes them to be uncomfortable, they laugh as a result of the tension. You\u0026rsquo;ll sometimes hear laughter when a joke is not appropriate and not funny. You could get laughs and never be asked back to speak just because they laughed.\n• What do other people do? Comedy club performers often fall victims to Monkey-See-Monkey-Do. They see other comics using obscene material and they follow their example. We can fall into that trap at a Toastmasters meeting. It\u0026rsquo;s possible for a club meeting to drift just a bit over the line of good taste. People make the mistaken conclusion that slightly crossing the line of good taste is perfectly okay. Before you know it, things can go from bad to worse. Just because something becomes common practice does not make it a measure of what\u0026rsquo;s right.\n• Isn\u0026rsquo;t innuendo acceptable? If you hint at or insinuate something, that\u0026rsquo;s OK only if saying the same thing clearly and directly is also all right. At a recent club meeting, one of our members asked that cell phones be turned off or set to vibrate. And then he added: \u0026ldquo;If anything other than a cell phone is vibrating, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to know about it.\u0026rdquo; To most people, this would be sexual innuendo. Would it be acceptable, at a professional meeting, to specifically say what he was inferring? Clearly not. Innuendo is not acceptable when it\u0026rsquo;s used to suggest something that would normally be off limits to say directly. Cloaking the unacceptable in subtle wording is no defense.\n• Am I trying too hard? A person who tries too hard to be funny is often tempted to cross the line of good taste. The rule of less is more applies to humor. Develop the ability to censor your humor ideas to eliminate the not-so-funny and the not-so-appropriate. You want to develop the reputation of someone who is funny and clean every time he or she speaks. That\u0026rsquo;s the target. The alternative is being someone who is funny part of the time. Or someone who uses clean humor some of the time. Not good. Set your goal high. Although you may occasionally and inadvertently miss the target, the fact is that high standards are the foundation for your professional reputation.\n• How should you practice? A California comedy improv troupe, where I occasionally played as a guest, had the habit of using a warm-up game called R-Rated Limericks. Although their goal was to produce a totally clean show for their audiences, they felt they could get the off-color jokes out of their systems during rehearsal warm-ups. I personally don\u0026rsquo;t think that is a good idea. You should practice the way you play. I\u0026rsquo;ve been directing my own improv troupe for 12 years. At our weekly workshop we try to keep everything as clean as though it were a public performance. In the same spirit, we should strive to keep every Toastmasters meeting in good taste. It builds the right kind of habits.\n• What is the opinion of people you respect? Get feedback from the Toastmasters you admire. My club, Powerhouse Pros in Las Vegas, Nevada, has many members who give insightful feedback. We have an observational humor segment in our meeting which potentially produces borderline jokes as speakers offer a variety of comments on everyday life. Whenever you are creating fresh, untested humor, you run the risk of unintentionally crossing the line of good taste. To help us stay on top of that issue, we design the meeting so that the observational humor part of the meeting comes before the general evaluator\u0026rsquo;s closing remarks. We expect the general evaluator to critique the appropriateness of the humor.\nRecently, we had a meeting where three of the jokes were a bit over the line - not obscene, but enough to make a few people uncomfortable. I sensed the president\u0026rsquo;s discomfort when he called for guest comments at the very end of the meeting. No one spoke up about the questionable humor. As the next meeting\u0026rsquo;s agenda was prepared, I asked for five minutes on the program to talk about the previous meeting\u0026rsquo;s humor. We need to actively seek feedback and give feedback to help keep us on track.\nDo speech contests have different standards from club meetings? No. Sometimes we see competitors cross the line of good taste. This creates the illusion that it might be acceptable to do that in a contest. Remember Monkey-See-Monkey-Do? Don\u0026rsquo;t let the risky contest behavior of others lead you to think that the standards are different from a regular club meeting. They are not.\nOne reason people push the limits in a speech contest is that presenting five-to-seven minutes of humor is a greater challenge than just getting a laugh or two at a regular meeting. In an effort to fill a speech with humor, some speakers take the easy road, using borderline humor.\nAnother reason people might push the limits in a contest: If you can skillfully master the challenge of walking the tightrope, it will probably be very funny. Let me share two contest speeches where I pushed the edge:\nThe first speech was a winner in a District Humorous Speech Contest. The speech had a 33 percent response rate. For every minute I was in front of the audience, they laughed for 20 seconds. That\u0026rsquo;s funny. I had sprinkled sexual innuendo throughout the speech. I never said anything directly, but hinted at lots of things that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been acceptable to say directly. After winning the district contest, I included that speech as part of my professional performances, and concluded that it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fit for a business audience. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know in 1983 what I now understand about innuendo failing the corporate-test question. It was great (even tame) material for a comedy club, but inappropriate for a Toastmasters or business audience.\nThe second speech - fast-forward about two decades - was on another edgy topic. The theme was: How To Succeed In Business by Going To Work Naked. Some Toastmasters would insist that such a topic could never win a Toastmasters speech competition. I won the district contest. Here was the challenge: Write a speech about going to work naked and never mention sex, body parts, or bodily functions. And no innuendo. What\u0026rsquo;s left? A funny 7-minute speech. The challenge was going beyond the cheap and easy laughs and working hard to construct a speech based on truly funny relationships. I avoided jokes used simply for the shock value. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to admit, my favorite line was one I couldn\u0026rsquo;t use. But even when you\u0026rsquo;re keeping it totally clean, there\u0026rsquo;s the risk that a small number of people in the audience who, upon just hearing the word naked, will have steam coming out their ears and will stop listening. And some of them might be judges. That\u0026rsquo;s the risk.\nThe reward is that I had a speech that was considered funny and in good taste by nearly everyone else in the room. The line is never clearly and firmly drawn. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to dance near the line, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to work really hard to keep the material funny for the right reasons. For me it\u0026rsquo;s a challenge and a rewarding growth experience. Do I recommend that you push the limits? Only if you also have more than 20 years experience as a professional humor performer. Otherwise, I recommend that you curb what will disturb.\n• How do I sharpen my skills to create good humor? First, practice at your club meetings. Try to use one piece of humor at every meeting. Second, become a lifelong student of humor. Study books that focus on creating and delivering funny lines. Analyze joke books that provide good, clean humor. I recommend you use joke books primarily as a source of inspiration to help you create your own original humor lines. We grow in baby steps and you won\u0026rsquo;t be a headliner at a comedy club tomorrow. But with the right focus and practice you\u0026rsquo;ll start to earn the reputation of a speaker who is funny.\nHere are some resources:\nComedy Writing Secrets by Melvin Helitzer\nThe Comedy Bible by Judy Carter\nComedy Writing Workbook by Gene_Parret\n2100 Laughs for All Occasions by Robert Orben\nMilton Berle\u0026rsquo;s Private Joke File by Milton Berle\nMuseumofhumor.com by Malcolm Kushner\n• What if I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if something crosses the line? When in doubt, leave it out. Period.\nOften it\u0026rsquo;s a fine line between keeping it clean and being offensive. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just a question of good judgment. I\u0026rsquo;ve been studying and using humor from the platform for 30 years. As each year passes, I believe more strongly that keeping your humor clean is the way to go. I\u0026rsquo;ve made the mistake in the past, more than once, of assuming that I can take more liberties with \u0026ldquo;this audience\u0026rdquo; - and have normally been wrong. I know that some speakers like the challenge of staying in good taste while still pushing it close to the edge. Depending on your experience level, you may find taking that risk is like flying on a trapeze without a safety net.\nAlways avoid going for the easy and cheap laugh. Work on your craft and become funny not because of your censor-worthy content, but because of your comedic craft. Be funny not because you shock, but because you shine. Be funny for the right reasons and you\u0026rsquo;ll stand out as a pro.\nBy John_Kande\n"},{"id":155,"href":"/docs/02-Working-Situations/04-AECL/11_facilitation/","title":"Facilitate the team","section":"AECL","content":" I think you will definitely get more buy in from the team if you say you are there to help facilitate getting things done and removing obstacles FOR them.

Some were intrigued, some were enthusiastic\u0026hellip; but most of our members were confused and concerned.\nWhat was the cause for all this dread? After all, most of us began telling tall tales on the playground. By the age of five, we found it easy to make a claim like, \u0026ldquo;I can kick a ball all the way to Kentucky!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My dog wagged his tail so fast that the news put out a tornado advisory.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been in a tall tales contest, you know the challenge is to come up with something more than just an outrageous claim - you have to write a contest-worthy story that develops and supports this claim. These can be more difficult to write than their deceptively simple themes suggest. The members of my club are all talented at writing humorous speeches, but our first efforts at writing truly clever tall tales failed.\nOur members were intimidated, and only two people signed up for the contest. That changed when our club came up with the following creative ideas. Soon, we discovered tall tales work like potato chips - once we started writing, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop at just one.\nHow to Begin\n Watch movies such as Big Fish or The Secret of Roan Inish to hear a variety of tall tales being told. Your local library may have books of tall tales to use as examples, as well, but remember that your tale must be original! You cannot simply copy a story from a book and change a few minor details. Also, be sure that your resources feature tall tales and not folk tales. They are distinctly different. Your club can practice coming up with ideas by a month before the contest. Each participant must describe a seemingly implausible event that happened to him or her. To add an extra punch, tell the participants that they may describe a true event if they wish. Then, have the audience guess whether the story is true or a tall tale. Pick a random sentence from a book of famous quotations and see what sort of a tall tale you can concoct using that sentence as a punch line. After you\u0026rsquo;ve tried this a few times, scan through the book for a quotation that captures your fancy. This also makes an excellent Table Topics theme. Write down five frustrating things that have happened to you recently. Use ordinary problems, such as being stuck in traffic, spilling coffee on your suit, having no time to do the dishes, and so on. Then try to come up with preposterous solutions that would help overcome these problems.  How to Develop Flavor\nAfter watching the movie Big Fish, try to copy the main character\u0026rsquo;s story-telling abilities. Notice the use of tone, speed of delivery and volume, as well as the use of language.\n Play around with accents\u0026hellip;. for a while. Then, drop the phony accent but try to retain some of the accent\u0026rsquo;s flavor. In other words, try adding a bit of drawl in places, or colorful phrases such as \u0026ldquo;Now there comes a time in everyone\u0026rsquo;s life,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;He was a most intelligent man.\u0026rdquo; Many people in our club also found their tales improved when they adopted a \u0026ldquo;bemused\u0026rdquo; tone of voice. Tall tales are the perfect speeches to practice alliteration, homonyms, triads, and all the other vocal variety techniques. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;Lady-bugs are found in many regions,\u0026rdquo; say, \u0026ldquo;From Leesburg to Louisville, the ladybugs lurk.\u0026rdquo; Used sparingly, rhymes can be very effective. Instead of saying, \u0026ldquo;The car was damaged,\u0026rdquo; try saying, \u0026ldquo;Repairs were extensive and expensive.\u0026rdquo; Add surprises (for example, a song, a dance, a howl, an unexpected body movement). Remember: Surprises are like pepper. A little bit adds a lot of flavor but if add too much, you ruin the result. Many tall tales become livelier with a little bit of repetition. This works best with any part that incorporates humorous gestures, such as: \u0026ldquo;The bear went up and down, and up and down, and up and down the mountain.\u0026rdquo;  It is funny to set up a predictable sequence of events, or a predictable sequence of logic, and then twist the final link in the sequence. Among successful humorists, the \u0026ldquo;Rule of Three\u0026rdquo; is popular. First, set up a joke. Second, reinforce the setup. Third, pay off with a punch line that smashes the pattern. For example, This porridge is too cold. This porridge is too hot. This porridge is asking to meet our leader!\nEditing Helps\n A good tall tale is about three to five minutes long. After five minutes, the audience begins to lose track of the details, or becomes overwhelmed by too many details. You may find it painful to delete humorous lines - however, a day or two later, when you read the speech again, you will realize the streamlined version is in fact better without one or two of the jokes. If the story involves bragging, consider telling it in the third person. For example, one member had a story about how dozens of fabulous men wanted to date her. The first time she told this tale, it bombed. Then she changed the main character so that it was a story about the fabulous men who wanted to date her sister. This one change made the same story much funnier. Videotape yourself telling the story. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have access to a video camera, you might be able to do a limited amount of taping with another appliance, such as a digital camera. Just taping a minute or two of your tall tale will help you see what parts need extra \u0026ldquo;oomph\u0026rdquo; or paring down. Don\u0026rsquo;t be too childish, and don\u0026rsquo;t be too adult. Tall tales are meant to amuse adults; childish language and too much fantasy (containing princesses, unicorns, elves, etc.) can make your story sound like a fairy tale. Don\u0026rsquo;t start off your story with \u0026ldquo;once upon a time\u0026rdquo; unless you are doing so ironically. On the other hand, tall tales work best when they have a certain wholesomeness. Some of our club members initially wrote \u0026ldquo;adult\u0026rdquo; stories with details that were mildly risque. They sounded like locker room jokes. There may be times, however, when you\u0026rsquo;ll want to keep adult humor in your tall tale. Just remember, any naughty references will be funnier if you tell them in the most chaste manner possible. Strive for innocent phrasing. It may help to picture yourself telling this story to a Ladies Garden Society. Whatever you do, don\u0026rsquo;t wink at the audience; this may seem like a good idea, but it comes across as sleazy.  Follow these steps and your club will soon enjoy writing and performing tall tales without hesitation. It worked well for us. In the end, all 35,000 people in our club wrote tall tales. You believe me, don\u0026rsquo;t you?\nElizabeth Keogan, ACS, is a member of Cascades Communicators Club 9064 in Sterling, Virginia, as well as Free Spirits Club 5160 in Reston, Virginia.\nA Tall Tale Should Include The Following Features:\n A character with extraordinary abilities and a specific goal. In the best tall tales these characters are also, for the most part, ordinary people with which the audience can easily identify. A problem that is solved in a humorous way. A careful blend of exaggerated and credible details. Don\u0026rsquo;t exaggerate everything in your tale. Use some realistic details to hook your audience, because they can picture themselves in such a situation. Then blend in exaggerated details to amaze them with a tall tale. With this judicious combination of various details you can really set up your audience to laugh. For example, a story about an ordinary person walking into a cave and encountering a bat as big as a bear cub can be hilarious. A story about a ten-foot-tall man digging a tunnel to the center of the Earth, where he encounters dragons and dinosaurs, is more fantasy than funny. A comical ending. The last lines should make the audience chuckle and/or groan. Clever twists and puns can also be sprinkled throughout the story.  Facts Tell, Stories Sell\nFollow the BASIC formula.\nFacts speak to a person\u0026rsquo;s intellect, stories touch the intellect and the emotion, a much more powerful factor in connecting with people. Fundraisers have been using the story technique for years. People will donate money if they are moved - either by personal experience or by a compelling story. Think about the number of times you are solicited for donations. Which causes are more likely to get your hard-earned dollars? What moved you to give? Watch the Jerry Lewis Telethon and you\u0026rsquo;ll see hundreds of stories about children with muscular dystrophy and other diseases and millions of dollars pledged.\nUse the power of story to improve any presentation you deliver. Here are five BASIC tips to help:\nBelieve in the story. Speak from your heart or from a real experience. Or pick a well-known story that supports your message.\nAppropriate. Is the story appropriate for your message and audience?\nStructure. Include an opening, a problem and a resolution. Stories are about journeys. You start off in one situation, face a problem, overcome the problem and grow or learn from the experience.\nInternalize. Practice! With enough rehearsal, the story becomes second nature and flows like part of a conversation.\nCaptivate. Bring the story to life and focus on your audience\u0026rsquo;s needs and your message. Use facial expressions, gestures, voice inflection or props, all tools learned in the Competent Communication manual.\nThose are the BASICs to help you get started talking with tales. For indepth practice, try Toastmasters' advanced manual on storytelling - it\u0026rsquo;s a great tool for learning to tell and incorporate stories into all your presentations.\nBy Carol Mon\n"},{"id":158,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/07-CGC-Senior-Tech/Interview/12_meet_expectactions/","title":"Meet Established Expectations","section":"Interview","content":"Q: 12.

Once we setup the analysis on the FIA instrument, the analyst could walk away and work on different tasks; and the FIA method takes less time. The senior technologist did not think it would make much difference in lab efficiency because of low sample volume and radioactivity. so I did not propose this method to our manager afterwards.\nCase 3: Regarding regression mode for calibration curve. I suggested linear regression, but technologists suggested quadratic (polynomial) regression.\nFrom lab management aspect,\nCase 1: Regarding the risk of installing a 6-port valve on the GC/MS instrument.\nI suggested I installed it, but the technologists concerned about waive of the service warranty, so they wanted to pay the service for installation. With the room of the budget, I put my opinion aside, and went with their option.\n"},{"id":168,"href":"/docs/03-Soft-Skills/02-Communication/50_4_levels_communication/","title":"4 Levels of Communication","section":"Communication","content":"Frameworks\nLevel 1: Present info that others understand #  Level 2: Take other’s perspective when communicating #  [Convey an understanding …]\n[respond to questions of others]\nSituation #1: Discussion in tool-box meeting.\nSituation #2: LIMS configuration.\nSituation #3: Setup performance objectives\nLevel 3: Adapt communication strategies to situations #  Situation #1: work with co-worker who was considered as a difficult personal.

The role-coaster ride goes on for most of us, basically since the day we are born until the day we die. In some periods of life successes may prevail and we may feel like standing on the top of the world. But sooner or later a huge setback arrives, teaching us a lesson of humility and acceptance.\nRecruiters and hiring managers know that we learn the most important lessons when things do not go as planed. It’s then that we have to use our creativity and try to change things, or learn our lesson and quit, starting from scratch on another project, pursuing some other dream, or a new walk of life.\nThat’s why questions about failures make a perfect sense in almost any interview. Try to show the interviewers that you take failures as they come, accept them, learn from them, and move on. Do not blame others for the bad results. Accept responsibility. They expect such an attitude from the very best job candidates.\nSample answers\n– Speaking honestly, I worked on many such projects in my life. I have always enjoyed venturing into the unknown, trying new things, innovating, experimenting. In my last job in sales I actually designed some new sales strategies, trying to capture leads on social media, such as Facebook groups. But I didn’t understand the platform well. After all my planning, and implementing, I actually captured only a few leads, and they did not convert anyway. However, I failed to reach my goal, but I learned something new and improved my skills with social media. I believe I will benefit from it in my professional career down the road.\n– This is my first job application, and I have not worked on any real projects so far in my life. But I had my fair share of successes and failures, for example in personal life and relationships. Maybe you can call a relationship with a man a project… I definitely failed in one. But instead of crying over my misfortune, I tried to analyze the relationship and identify things that I did wrong. I wanted to do it better next time. I believe that the same attitude can be applied to failures in work. We cannot entirely avoid them, but it’s our attitude to failure that matters.\n– Successful people do not fail. They either succeed, or learn. This is my attitude to both work and life. Surely as a manager I failed to reach my targets many times. If I always reached them, I would not be here interviewing for a job with you… But I did not consider it a failure. It would be a failure if I didn’t try hard enough, which was never the case. I tried my best, and it didn’t work out. Is it a failure? I would not say so. It’s a learning experience, something inevitable in a life of any successful man.\n– I remember one demand forecast that went completely wrong. My employer paid the price, losing money in the process. But it was my mistake. What happened is that I underestimated certain market indicators, and was too optimistic in my analysis, predicting much greater demand for a certain product in the summer months. The company bought stock and proceeded accordingly, but my predictions were wrong and at the end of summer we ended up with a lot of stock that we could not sell during autumn or winter. But I prefer not think about it much. It happened, I learned my lesson, and I would not repeat the same mistake.\n– I am just trying to get my first job with you, and have no previous working experience. Still young enough to experience some big failures, things that will shape me and teach me the most important lessons. However, you can be sure that I can admit making a mistake, and take responsibility for my actions. I will try to learn from my failures. And while this is an excellent company and you have a renowned training program for new hires, some failures will inevitably come. That’s the way it works in human life.\n– My biggest failure so far was when I did not succeed in getting to a college of my choice. I prepared hard for the entrance exams and for the interviews, did what I could. It was not enough. At the end of the day, I simply had to accept that other candidates were better, and move on. But I already learned that a failure can be a blessing in disguise. Maybe I will get this job with you, make a great career in your company, and eventually end up happy that I did not succeed to get to college.\n Reference: Interviewpenguin\n"},{"id":173,"href":"/posts/Unfavorable_policy/","title":"Unfavorable Policy","section":"Tags","content":"CEO, manager, programmer, manual worker – they all have to comply with policies, rules, and laws that govern different sectors of economy, as well as with the internal policies and procedures of an organization they work for.\nNot every rule makes sense, and not each procedure is the most effective one. Yet there are higher goals we have to keep in mind–public safety, environment, justice. Once you start your own business, you can set at least some rules. But as long as you enjoy the comfort of regular monthly paycheck, you have to adhere to the rules of your employer.\nThis question makes sense in most job interviews, and we will now have a look at 7 sample answers. They hiring managers may also structure the question differently, asking you to “Describe your experience interpreting policies, procedures, rules and regulations“, or to “Describe a situation in which you disagreed with a rule or policy and how you handled it.” But they are always asking about the same thing really, and my sample answers should work for each of the questions.\n7 Sample answers to “Tell us about a time you had to comply with a policy or procedure that you did not agree with” interview question #   In my last job in a warehouse I did not agree with the way we organized the stock in the place. I’ve been working with stock for ten years, and could clearly see that it wasn’t the most effective way of organizing it. As a result we often we did not have enough space for incoming supplies. I shared my concerns with the logistics manager. They heard me out and said they’d look into it. But nothing changed. I pointed out the issue again, but it was quickly dismissed. So I continued to do my job, as well as I could, though I knew it wasn’t the most effective way of work. But someone else was responsible for making decisions, and I accepted it as a fact. Because this is my first job application, it is impossible to narrate any similar situation from work. But I didn’t agree with certain procedures at school, such as segregation of students with special needs in separate classes. In my opinion we should try to integrate the students into regular classes, regardless of the degree of their disability. Once they leave the school there won’t be any segregation in the job market, any special conditions for them… But I also acknowledge that I am still young, and may not understand all the pluses and minuses of inclusion or segregation at school. School administrators should know better, and hence they decided for segregation. I didn’t agree, but I complied. There was so much bureaucracy in my last job. We had to report exactly what we did during each 30 minutes in work. In my opinion, it was a stupid policy. Because sometimes you spent 5 minutes from each working hour reporting, remembering what you did, and at the end of the working day you spent 1 hour reporting about things you did, instead of doing more things. It was actually one of the reasons why I left the company, but while I worked there I complied to the policy. I’ve been in an army for ten years, and I can assure you that I do not have a problem with obeying rules and procedures. To be honest, it is not my business to think about the internal policies of the organization or company, because it’s not my organization. Someone else set the rules and if I decided to work for them, I have to obey them. I think that it is important to study the rules and to learn about everything important before you start the job. Once working, however, we should respect the rules. I found it hard to respect the “silence after 10pm” policy in the last hostel where I worked, and disagreed with this rule. Mostly young people stayed at the place. At 10pm the fun just starts in such hostels, at least in my opinion and experience. But maybe the owners or managers had to respect some regulations set by the municipality, or they had their own reasons for this policy, which I could not understand from my position of an ordinary employee. Nevertheless, they were not prospering, and I had to leave the place anyway. I have never found it hard. Prison is a place of order–or at least it should be. Working as a correctional officer, I considered it extremely important to adhere to the rules, to follow all protocols. Yes, it can be difficult sometimes. For example when you have to take a coercive action against an inmate, and you know it isn’t necessary. But if they break the rules they have to be punished. We had a strict no mobile phones and no social media policy in my last job, or at least that’s how I interpreted it. This was something really hard for me to follow. I must admit I was addicted to looking at my phone and checking my Instagram and Facebook. But I did not realize this until I started to work for the company. It was hard to comply with the rules, but at the end of the day they helped me to beat my social media addiction. I am grateful that the company had such strict rules in place.  You can share your opinion, but you should obey the rules–or leave\nIt is fine to share your opinion with your superiors, if you consider a rule ineffective, or outright stupid. Feedback should flow freely in all directions in a successful company. An excellent manager should welcome your critical feedback, they should even thank you for telling them that something can be done in a more effective manner.\nBut this is basically where your role ends. You share the feedback, you suggest the improvements, but it’s someone else’s responsibility to decide, and to perhaps change the policy for better. At the end you should accept the decision, comply with the policy, or leave the company if you find it unacceptable from ethical or other point of view.\nRefer to school or public life if you have no working experience\nSpeaking honestly, our entire life is ruled by laws and policies. And this is true regardless of your country of origin or residence. Unless you are a renegade and gave up on human society, you have to comply with policies and laws.\nIf you apply for your very first job, you can refer to a situation from school, public life, court of justice, anything. But the attitude should remain the same–you found it difficult to comply with the policy, but you eventually did comply, because you respect the decision makers. Or you did break the rules and ended up in police custody for one night, but that’s not the story to share with your interviewers :).\nShow humility, praise the policy which you originally didn’t like\nIn some cases you may even go the full circle, and start to love the policy you initially hated. Just look at the last sample answer in this post. The applicant hated the “no mobile phones” policy in work, and found it extremely hard to comply with it. But eventually they did comply, and beat their social media addiction. Most hiring managers will love to hear such stories in the interviews.\nAnother nice example or respecting the hierarchy and showing humility is the first sample answer from this article. The warehouse worker likely had more experience than their young manager. They’ve been working with stock for ten years, and likely were right about their observations.\nInstead of getting frustrated by the response of the management they decided to obey their decision, and to continue trying their best in work, regardless of the ineffective procedure of stocking the incoming inventory…\nConclusion, answers to other tricky interview questions\nWe live in a global economy where everything relates to everything. Some rules and policies may seem stupid to us, or even totally ineffective, but the people who set them likely have their reasons. And we never see the entire picture from our position.\nEnsure your interviewers that you are ready to share a constructive feedback with your superiors (if you didn’t like a rule or procedure in work), but at the end of the day you will respect the hierarchy and obey to the rules in the workplace.\n Reference: Interviewpenguin\n"},{"id":174,"href":"/docs/02-Working-Situations/04-AECL/08_huddle_meeting/","title":"08 Huddle Meeting","section":"AECL","content":"Brend, new hire, un-ionized ammonia, method development, Randy\u0026rsquo;s guidance, huddle meeting, SOP preparation.\nRandy returned in Sep, 2015.\n"},{"id":175,"href":"/docs/01-Interview-Experience/09-BV-Winnipeg/Interview/01_all_questions/","title":"All Questions","section":"Interview","content":"The interview was held on June 27th, 2019 in the morning.\nQ#1: Briefly introduce your education, work experience, and why you left the job Response at the interview:\nM Sc. of Chemistry, B Sc. of chemistry.\n7 years in AECL, 4 years in Testmark/Accuracy\nI performed very well, but in 2015 company decided to cut off the analysis service, so I was laid-off.\nQ#2: Example of Safety Implementation Response at the interview:\n monthly lab tour\ncheck list: eyewash stations, cords, shower, velocity of fume hoods,\nto be mentioned next time: refer to the new page. annual objectives: numbers of near miss reporting safety culture: no bread allowed (for wearing respirator)\n小结：前几次的面试中曾经有类似问题，我都没有把以前的材料拿出来翻翻。我没有提及简历上讲到的30，这个量化指标。第二和第三条都无需说。  Q#3: How did you do when implementing unpopular policy?\nResponse at the interview:\ndecision: lay-off of the whole group.

However, many factors go into the final decision. Some of them have nothing to do with you, but with circumstances. For example, someone from within the company got recommended for the same position by a manager from another department. Since that person already knows about the company and its culture and modus operandi, it may save the hiring manager time and cost in getting the internal candidate onboard and getting productive than hiring someone from outside. Or the company faced some budget issues and rescinded the job requisition.\nAn excellent way to take rejection is to understand that it is a numbers game, and odds usually are higher for rejection than acceptance. In sales training, the reps learn that of the100 leads that one gets, the chances of actually closing a sale are probably 3 or 4%. It is the same with direct mail. So each rejection has less to do with a sales rep’s skill alone, and more with the buyer’s circumstances and readiness to actual readiness to buy. The same is true of any situation where competition exists.\nThe important part is never to stop trying. Many successful actors suffered rejections in auditions, but they would never have made it if they stopped. All one needs is just one break to prove their talent and skill.\nDon’t build an unrealistic expectation, just go with an attitude that even with your best interview, there is a 50% chance that you will get the job, but also a 50% chance that you may not. The higher the number of applicants, the heavier the odds against a positive outcome. BUT as they say in the lottery commercials, “ You have to be in it, to win it.”.

Communication skills are, therefore regarded as an essential skill by employers. When you’re going for a job interview, you can be sure that the interviewer will ask you about your communication skills. Communication job interview questions are asked in almost every interview, regardless of the position you’re applying for.\nThe interviewer wants to test and evaluate your communication skills and find out how you handle challenging work situations. Your answers give the interviewer the information needed to assess whether or not you’re the right candidate for the job.\nIn this article, interview questions about your communication skills are discussed. Furthermore, information is provided on how you should approach and answer these questions. Also, read more about frequently asked job interview questions here and check our job interview preparation checklist.\n 1 Communication Job Interview Questions \u0026amp; Answers\nWhy the interviewer is asking about your communication skills #  In a work environment, a lot of processes rely heavily on sharing information. Therefore, strong communication skills are essential in order to deliver and understand information accurately and quickly. Poor communication skills can negatively impact business processes and could cause misunderstanding, frustration, and even failure. This is one of the factors why interviewers want to assess your skills. In general, questions about your communication skills are asked to measure your ability to communicate in different situations and with different personalities. The ability to communicate efficiently is needed not only for being productive in your work but also for creating a healthy work environment.\nEmployees, no matter their position in the company or seniority level, interact with colleagues, team leaders, managers, clients, customers, or partners daily. This is why good communication skills are important in the workplace. For instance, a senior manager should have the ability to communicate tough decisions and possess the ability to handle difficult situations and discussions at work. Customer service representatives need to come across as genuine, friendly, and empathetic when talking to unsatisfied customers.\nA job interview allows employers to assess and evaluate how the candidates communicate and handle situations. The questions they asked can also focus on teamwork to see how you collaborate on teams and whether or not you are able to efficiently convey and listen to messages.\nOne way to get answers is by using behavioral job interview questions. These types of strategic interview questions require you to provide the interviewer with an example situation that you experienced in your career. Behavioral job interview questions focus on work situations that you experienced in the past and how you responded to them. The way you respond to these questions tells the interviewer more about your work methods and ethics.\nBehavioral job interview questions #  Certain job interview questions that the interviewer asks you to assess your communication skills are called ‘ behavioral job interview questions.’ These questions focus on professional work situations that you experienced in the past. The way you respond to questions about handling situations tells the interviewer more about how you convey your message.\nThere are several reasons why interviewers use behavioral interview questions. The objective of a hiring manager is, of course, to hire the best candidate for the job. They want to avoid hiring the person that they ‘like’ best and need something better to assess whether or not a candidate is a right fit for the job. By asking you questions that let them analyze your professional behavior in the workplace, the interviewer can test your suitability for the position.\nBehavioral job interview questions usually start with:\n Give me an example of Tell me about a time when you Have you ever What do you do when Describe situations where  These interview questions are often used to assess certain skills such as communication, but also about your level of adaptability, teamwork, or leadership skills. The interviewer will focus his questions on important characteristics that you need to possess to be regarded as suitable for the position. Your past behavior in professional work settings will be discussed. The reason for asking behavioral job interview questions instead of just asking traditional ones is that the most accurate predictor of future performance is your past performance in similar situations.\nInterviewers consider the following when using behavioral questions in a job interview:\n Bad hires are costly  Hiring the wrong candidate is one of the most expensive mistakes a company can make. A bad hire can have an impact on the rest of the team and even worse, their clients/customers. The costs of turnovers are high, not only in terms of money but also in terms of time. Therefore, interviewers ask you different kind of questions to assess your suitability.\n Specific details of your professional behavior  Behavioral interview questions are used by interviewers to determine how your past performance aligns with their current hiring needs. The answer you give provides the interviewer with more insight into your behavior in the workplace, your problem-solving skills, and personal attributes.\n Past behavior in the workplace is a good predictor for future performance  Interviewers ask you about how you handled situations in the past because for them this is a good indicator of your future success. This proven technique can give more insight into your future work performance. Therefore, prepare well for these questions and expect questions about communication such as ‘ describe a challenging work situation and how you overcame it?‘, ‘ Have you ever had difficulty working with a manager?‘ ‘ What’s your approach to delegating work to others?‘, or ‘ Tell me about a time you managed an important project?‘. All these questions require you to highlight how you communicated in that particular situation. Based on your answers, the interviewer wants to assess whether or not you’re a fit for the job and company.\n The interviewer can avoid making the wrong decision  The ultimate goal of using behavioral interview questions is to make the right hiring decision. Interviewers are interested in your previous patterns in work-related situations. This information gives them more insight into your approach to critical situations and if this approach matches the ones required for the position you’re applying for. By preparing the right way, you can make sure that your example answer situations include aspects of the important job requirements. Of course, the interviewer is looking for candidates that fit the job description, so make sure to make your answers related.\nWhy your communication skills matter to the interviewer #  As said earlier, communication skills are vital in the workplace. The interviewer wants to know how you approach certain situations. It’s therefore important that you are able to demonstrate the needed skills for the job in your answers. The example situations you use should demonstrate that you can take on the day-to-day tasks required for the position and have development potential.\nBehavioral interview questions are used to find out who you really are and how you go about handling certain situations. The interviewers want to get the following questions answered:\n Are you easy to get along with? Can you communicate effectively with different personalities? Are you able to adequately respond to situations that occur during your work? Are you able to adjust to changing work environments? Can you assist your coworkers or team when needed? Are you flexible in your approaches to situations at work?  Top communication skills that interviewers are looking for #  There are several communication skills that interviewers can be looking for during a job interview. Most of these are general in nature and applicable to most work situations that you can encounter in your workplace. If you really want to stand out from the competition, you need to do your research the right way by figuring out what exact communication skills the employer values. Once you know this, you can play into the situation by highlighting your communication skills in example scenario’s on how you handled similar situations in the past. Remember, strong communication skills will really help you get hired, get promoted, and will help you progress further throughout your career.\nListening #  Communication starts with listening effectively. It’s important to take your time to actually listen to what the other person is trying to say practice your active listening skills. Nobody likes to communicate with a person who only cares about conveying their own story and does not take time to listen to someone else. Some who has the right listening skills listens with his/her whole body, is alert and is genuinely interested in another person. A good listener does not interrupt someone else mid-conversation and reflects back on what you heard the other person saying.\nNon-verbal communication #  Communication is much more than just words and the message that they convey. It includes implicit messages through non-verbal behavior. Non-verbal behavior includes your facial expressions, eye contact, the pitch, and tone of your voice, and gestures that you make through your body language such as hand, arm, and leg postures. Some research estimates suggest that around seventy to eighty percent of all communication is non-verbal.\nEnsure that you use your non-verbal communication to reinforce what you’re saying in words during a job interview.\nEmpathy #  Demonstrating empathy means that you are able to understand and share the feelings of somebody else. Of course, in a professional work environment, everybody will have their own ideas on how things should be done. However, even though you might have disagreements with your colleagues or superiors, you should always consider and respect their point of view.\nFriendliness #  The right tone is important in any kind of communication. The actual way you say things impacts the way your message is received. A friendly tone leads to others being encouraged to communicate with you. Being polite will get you a long way in all your workplace interaction, whether it’s face-to-face or written communication.\nCohesion, clarity, and concision #  When you communicate with other people, make sure that you’re clear, concise, and articulate. Good communication is not only about saying the right thing, but also about communicating your message to-the-point and efficiently. A lack of clarity in a message can result in confusion or even a poor decision.\nEmotional intelligence #  Your emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of others as well. This ability is important for employers because if you have a high EI, you’re more likely to express your emotions healthily in the workplace. Also, you’re more likely to understand the emotions of your coworkers and clients. In turn, this can enhance working relationships in the workplace and impact performance in a positive way.\nWays of showing emotional intelligence are, for instance, through active listening. You can also demonstrate emotional intelligence by showing the right emotions to establish a connection with the interviewer. Think of smiling (as long as it does not appear inauthentic or forced) and showing enthusiasm and excitement for the position. Other ways of demonstrating emotional intelligence is:\n By sharing the credit for team achievements Demonstrating how you are trying to improve yourself as a professional Showing that you can learn from your mistakes through examples Not shying away from discussing conflict situations at work  Confidence #  Showing confidence when you’re conveying your message is crucial. However, showing confidence does not mean over-confident or cocky. Demonstrating to the interviewer that you can, for instance, interact with customers with confidence will have a positive effect on your chances. Provide them with examples that show that you can convince customers in such a way that they get faith in your abilities to deliver whatever it is they need.\nShowing confidence in a job interview can be done in several ways. First off, make sure that you practice keeping good eye contact while you’re listening, but also when you’re speaking yourself. When it comes to your body position you want to maintain a neutral and open position. Don’t cross your arms but keep them by your side. Furthermore, talk clearly and slowly during the interview. Other than that, smile! Come across as if you’re enjoying the process through calm facial expressions.\nThe final tip to show confidence in a job interview is by interviewing the interviewer. Besides that this shows that you’re well prepared it’s an opportunity to indicate that you’re not looking for any position, but that you’re looking for the right position.\nRespect #  Respecting other people’s opinion and ideas is key for a good communicator. When you convey respect towards other people, they will be more open to communicating with you. You can show respect through various simple actions such as mentioning someone’s name, through eye contact during the conversation and actively listening when somebody is talking. Make sure the person you’re talking to feels appreciated and stay focused when talking to them.\nOpen-mindedness #  Being flexible and open-minded in conversations are traits of strong communicators. Try to understand another person’s point of view and actively listen to the message that they are trying to convey. Even if you disagree, always remain calm and see if you can reach a middle ground that could benefit all parties involved. When you approach situations or discussions, open-minded a successful outcome is more likely to happen.\nTone of voice #  The tone of voice that you use can influence and steer the whole conversation. You can imagine that if you start your conversation in a calm and constructive way, the person you’re talking to will be more inclined to respond similarly. The same way goes the other way around. If you start by going on the offensive, your conversation partner is more likely to do the same. Make sure that you control the level of emotion and the volume of your voice the right way.\nFrequently asked job interview questions about communication skills #  Below you find a list of common interview questions about communication.\n  Tell me about your greatest accomplishment  Describe a time you had a conflict and how you resolved it  Where do you see yourself in five years?

Preparing answers to job interview questions about communication #  There are several important elements to take into consideration when you’re preparing for job interview questions about your communication skills. Include the following point in your interview preparation:\nDo your research #  Thoroughly study the job description and company in general as the start of your interview preparation. This research will help you identify the needed competencies, skills, and abilities.\nWrite down a list of competencies, skills, and abilities #  Behavioral interview questions are very good to actually demonstrate your talent, competencies, and results. Based on the competencies, skills, and abilities you have identified, you can prepare answers to behavioral questions. A lot of companies are looking for similar skills such as teamwork, leadership, flexibility, attention to detail, adaptability, creativity, responsibilities, etc. Rank the skills on importance in relation to the requirements of the job that you are interviewing for.\nCome up with a list of your past experiences that relate to the job you’re applying for #  Next, make a list of past work experiences. Make sure to highlight successful situations where you demonstrated behavior related to the competencies, skills, and abilities required for the job. Focus on delivering a concise and to-the-point answer.\nFocus on successful situations and challenging ones #  Just like you should be able to discuss a successful situation, you should also be prepared to answer questions about challenging situations. Make sure that you have some examples ready of situations in which you faced a challenge but came out successfully. Tell the interviewer what you did, why you did it, and what the outcome was. Also, explain what you learned from the situation. Focus on demonstrating problem-solving ability, adaptability, and ability to professionally approach situations. There’s always a chance that the interviewer will ask a follow-up question to test your self-awareness by asking how you might handle a similar kind of situation differently now.\nUse the STAR method to structure your answer #  During your job interview, the interviewer wants to discuss previous work situations and wants you to elaborate on them. By preparing example scenarios, you can give exactly the information that he or she is looking for. Make sure that you provide the interviewer the situation you were in, your task in that situation, the action you took, and the specific results that can come out of those actions. In short, this is called the STAR-method of providing an answer. The STAR method is discussed in more detail later on in this article.\nThe STAR method allows you to concisely provide the interviewer an answer by logically walking them through the situation. Below the STAR method is discussed step by step.\nGeneral elements to consider when structuring your answer: #    Give the interviewer an answer in the form of a ‘story’ and structure this story logically. Use the STAR interview technique to do this. STAR is an acronym that stands for a situation (S), your task (T) in that situation, the actions (A) you took, and what results (R) you got based on your actions. These are the basic steps you take in your walkthrough.\n  Display the skills and abilities that are needed for the job you’re applying for and that the interviewer wants to see. Make sure you match your qualifications to the job and skills as mentioned in the job description.\n  Be honest. Interviewers will notice if you make a story up. Also, they will ask follow-up questions to go more in-depth into the situation you provide them with. Make sure to prepare several example situations of skills and abilities that you think will be discussed based on your research.\n  STAR Interview Technique #  Behavioral job interview questions are best answered by providing example situations according to the STAR method. This way, you can give interviewers exactly what they are looking for. Also, it allows you to provide a concise and to the point answer about how you acted in previous work situations. Below the STAR acronym is broken down into each step.\nSituation #  When you give your answer to the interviewer, start by setting the stage. Provide context around the situation or challenge you were facing. Also, make sure to provide relevant details.\nTask #  After you describe the situation, talk about your specific responsibilities and what your role was. It’s important that the interviewer gets an understanding of your task.\nAction #  Then, talk about the actions you took to resolve the challenges you were facing. Provide the interviewer with a step by step description of what actions you took.\nResult #  Finally, talk about the outcomes of your actions. Make sure to take credit for your behavior that led to the result. Here you answer questions such as What happened? What did you accomplish? Also, provide the interviewer with information about what you learned from the situation. Make sure to focus on positive results and positive learning experiences.\nSample answers to interview questions about communication #  Below you will find some example interview questions about your communication skills. Some example answers are longer than others, and it’s up to you to figure out how concise your message should be during a job interview. In the examples below a lot of detail is included to convey your message the right way. However, these are ‘general’ examples. Do not forget to structure your own answers in a way that convinces the interviewer that you’re the right person for the job!\nCommunication interview question example 1: #  The first questions regard a situation in which you had challenges working with a manager or other superior. It’s important to approach such situations in a diplomatic way in order to change the situation.\n‘Tell me about a time you had difficulties working with a manager. How did you address these challenges?’\n‘In my previous position, I worked with a team supervisor, where I initially had difficulties getting along with. With regard to my job performance, I got less feedback than I got from other managers in my career, which sometimes made it difficult to meet expectations. This made it challenging for me to evaluate my performance, as well. In the beginning, we had a few disagreements, but I found out that these were based on misunderstandings in communication.\nI requested a meeting with her and asked if she could provide me with more direct and specific feedback on work that needed to be done. She understood what I asked her and from that day on, we were on the same page in terms of expectation. We had a successful working relationship for over four years after that meeting and worked together on several large projects. What I learned from my previous experience is that I should take time to discuss management styles with new managers and make sure that expectations from both sides are clear. Clear communication is definitely the key to success.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\n This is an honest answer about a situation that required you to use your communication skills. The answer includes how you communicated throughout the process and which actions you took to address the situation. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience.  Communication interview question example 2: #  This question regards a situation in which you had to manage an important project. As with everything in the workplace, clear communication is key. It’s your goal to demonstrate that you possess solid communication skills in order to get your message across and get the project done according to the set requirements.\n‘Tell me about a time you had to manage an important project. How did you approach this, and how did you communicate your strategy?’\n‘I’ve been involved in multiple important projects in my previous position as a sales manager. One time I was asked to set up a project team to work on a sales pitch to convince a new client to use our services. The pressure was on because it was a 5-year deal and a multi-million dollar contract that was at stake. For the company as well as for me personally, this was a big deal. As this deal would mean a lot for the company in terms of turnover increase, I understood that failure was not an option because it was a unique opportunity.\nI gathered a team of the most experienced employees and selected them based on their individual qualities and strengths to make sure to balance the team out. Together with the team, a planning document was set up, and goals and milestones were determined. After that, I delegated tasks based on the knowledge and experience levels of each team member. Also, I hired a project manager to carefully monitor the progress on a day to day basis and report to me on the milestone progress.\nBecause I distributed the responsibilities according to experience and knowledge levels, everyone on the team was aware of their responsibilities and the importance of the project. The team delivered everything on time without requiring intense oversight. We finished our sales pitch ahead of the deadline and were able to provide the client with everything he asked for. The client told us that he was impressed by our efforts, and we landed the contract, which was the largest contract closed in that year. This was a great accomplishment for the team as it was an effort that could not have been made without the people on it.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\n This example shows that you are able to perform under pressure and communicate a strategy to a team. The provided example is related but also relevant to the workplace. It demonstrates that you are able to adapt to a situation. This answer shows important skills such as clear communication, proactive, problem-solving skills, teamwork, and creativity.  Communication interview question example 3: #  Demonstrating leadership is all about clear communication and making sure everybody is fully aware of their responsibilities. These questions are often asked in more senior positions but can also be asked in graduate-level job interviews. Interviewers ask this to gauge your leadership potential.\n‘Tell me about a time you had to demonstrate leadership.’\n‘In my previous position, where we ran behind on a new company-wide system upgrade that was going to fix issues we had with our online orders. The delay in implementation took longer than expected and caught us off guard. We had the holidays coming up, which counts for almost 25% of our annual revenue. My team had to work double shifts to process all orders, and the outlook was that this was needed until the system upgrade was placed. This led to people being stressed and overworked, which cause the team morale to drop. As the team manager, it was my responsibility to get the team performance back to normal.\nI gathered the team to discuss the situation. I expressed my appreciation for their effort during this challenging situation for the department and company in general. During our meeting, I called upon their assistance to find a way for the team to work more efficiently, including myself, for however long the system update was not implemented yet. I actively participated in the group’s brainstorming session and encouraged the team members to talk freely and discuss options. After an hour, we created a shortlist of options on which we voted. I created teams of two within the team to further investigate how we could implement the discussed options.\nThe result and learning moments\nThe reaction of the team to this approach was very positive. They appreciated being involved in such an important process to work on a solution that would benefit both the team and the company. By working together and focussing on a shared goal, the team worked in a productive and creative way to find a solution. Also, the fact that their ideas would be heard immediately helped to come up with several solutions that could be implemented right away. These solutions saved us valuable time and energy. One of the ideas was to bring in temporary workers that could be trained on the job by the current team members for as long as the update was not implemented. This ultimately led to us hitting our marks for the holiday season. We were able to reach the needed levels of revenue.\nListening to team members and quickly taking action to follow-up to their ideas really helped increase work efficiency and morale. Based on this positive experience, we decided to include such brainstorming and idea evaluations into our monthly meetings. This way, team members would stay more engaged, and we would get more knowledge of what actually goes own in the heads of the team members. Also, there’s now a plan in place with the HR department in case such a situation occurs again in the future to make sure we always have enough people to perform up to our potential.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\n This answer shows that you are able to handle unexpected situations while still being able to strategize and lead a team. This shows that you take responsibility when it’s time to do so. The answer includes how you communicated throughout the process and which actions you took to address the situation. Also, the answer shows that you can handle and structure a team while still communicating clearly and involving everybody in the process. This is what leadership is all about. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience.  Communication interview question example 4: #  Certain situations in the professional workplace require some extra motivation. Motivating others is done through communication. This question requires you to explain how you motivate others and give an example of a time when you did.\n*‘Tell me about a time you had to motivate your team and how you did this.’\n‘When I worked at XYZ as a project manager, the company hit a rough patch which led to company-wide layoffs. My team consisted of ten team members, but after the layoffs, we remained with six, but we were still responsible for the duties of the four co-workers that left the company. As a result, we fell behind on production and team morale suffered as well. This, in turn, led to more errors on the work floor. As the project manager, I was ultimately responsible for team performance, so it was my duty to get the team back on track.\nI got together with the team to discuss the problems they encountered and to discuss strategies on how we could work our way through these issues. First and foremost, I complimented them on their effort and dedication during this complex time for everyone. After hearing their challenges, I asked them to give suggestions on how we could solve them and how we could increase our effectiveness and efficiency. We brainstormed for over an hour in which every team member had his or her say, and wrote down ideas that could benefit us. After a team vote, we prioritized the ideas, and each team member got assigned a task.\nThe team reacted positively after being included in the approach to solve the issues in this challenging time. They were able to present their own solutions and could immediately start research the feasibility. We came up with specific ideas that could be implemented fairly quickly and increase efficiency.\nThe result and learning moments\nFirst off, we asked our team assistants to clean up the agenda’s of everybody on the team so that only important meetings remained. Then, we asked the team assistants to pick up some tasks that were burdens for the other team members. This way, the team could analyze the additional work that needed to be done and share these tasks among each other. This made the team more efficient and effective. Also, it boosted the morale up again because even though it was a challenge and a lot of work, team members knew what they needed to do and what their responsibilities were.\nBy actively involving the team in important decisions about team strategy, we got better results. We decided to implement such brainstorm sessions into our monthly meetings.’\nWhy is this a strong answer?\n This is an honest answer about a difficult time in a company that required you to step up and motivate others. The answer described the situation clearly and what you did to motivate others in order to work your way through challenging times. The answer includes how you communicated with your team and how you included them in the process. Finally, a conclusion of your actions is mentioned but also what’s equally as important; what you learned from your experience.

five years I hope to be working with an employer in an increasingly responsible position, that enables me to utilize my talents and work closely with my colleagues in solving important problems. I see myself taking on new and exciting challenges in an enjoyable environment and hopefully this will be with your company.\u0026rdquo;\n Describe a major goal you\u0026rsquo;ve set for yourself recently. Give an example of a goal you both set and achieved. Ideally, this should be a professional goal; such as improved time management skills, achieved new performance targets, or learned a new skill. A personal example can also be appropriate if it reinforces your pattern of accomplishments. For example, if you take a great deal of initiative and quickly move into leadership positions, you might use a personal example relating to your recent community work: organized a community walk-a-thon that raised $30,000 in matching funds to purchase new computers for the local library. Talk about results of achieving your goal. This indicates you set realistic goals and that you can focus on outcomes. Select an example that has interesting outcomes related to your efforts. The example should showcase your skills and abilities.\n The Best Answers to Tough Interview Questions\nTell me about yourself. This is really more of a request than a question. But these few words can put you on the spot in a way no question can. Many quickly lose control of the interview during the most critical time- the first five minutes. This is not the time to go into a lengthy history or wander off in different directions. Your response should be focused and purposeful. Communicate a pattern of interests and skills that relate to the position in question. Consider your response to this question as a commercial that sells your autobiography. Provide an answer that includes information about where you grew up, where you went to school, your initial work experience, additional education and special training, where you are now, and what you intend to do next. One of the most effective ways to prepare for this question is to develop a 60-second biographic sketch that emphasizes a pattern of interests, skills, and accomplishments. Focus your response around a common theme related to your major interests and skills. Take, for example, the following response, which emphasizes computers. \u0026ldquo;I was born in Canton, Ohio and attended Lincoln High School. Ever since I was a teenager, I tinkered with computers. It was my hobby, my passion, and my way of learning. Like most kids I enjoyed computer games. When my folks gave me a computer as a reward for making honor roll my sophomore year, I mastered DOS, Windows, and WordPerfect within six months. I then went on to teach myself programming basics. By the time I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to study programming. From that point on, everything fell into place. My life revolved around computing. By my junior year at Syracuse, I decided I wanted to work for a major software manufacturer. That is why I had an internship last summer at FastTrack Software. I now want to work for a major player so I can be at the forefront of breaking trends and new technology. When my college roommate told me about his start in your department, I hounded him until he helped me get a referral, which brought me here today. I am prepared to answer any questions you may have about my education and experience.\u0026rdquo; This response sets a nice tone for starting the interview. The interviewee is able to say a lot within 60 seconds by staying focused. The message is clear: the interviewee has both passion and focus relating to the position. He stays on message and concludes by leaving the door open for additional questions about his education and experience. Unfortunately some candidates get off on the wrong foot by rambling on for several minutes about their childhood, family, hobbies, travels, and interests. Repeat Key Accomplishment Statements Throughout the interview you will be asked numerous questions about your attitude and ability to do the job. Whenever possible, talk about your accomplishments in terms of what you did and the results of your actions for employers. Give examples of your effectiveness, which should include specific skills and statistics.\nWhere do you see yourself five years from now? This open-ended question is one of the most difficult and stressful ones job seekers face. Employers ostensibly ask this question because they are looking for people who know what they want to do and who are focused on specific professional goals. If you lack goals, you will have difficulty answering this question. Be sure you arrive at the interview with a clear vision of what you want to do today, tomorrow and five years from now. Be consistent with the objective on your resume and the skills and accomplishments you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to the interviewer. Your answer should be employer-centered. For example, \u0026ldquo;In five years I hope to be working with an employer in an increasingly responsible position, that enables me to utilize my talents and work closely with my colleagues in solving important problems. I see myself taking on new and exciting challenges in an enjoyable environment and hopefully this will be with your company.\u0026rdquo; Do not indicate that you hope to start your own business, change careers, or go back to school. Such responses indicate a lack of long-term interest since you do not plan to be around for long. While some may respond that they honestly haven\u0026rsquo;t really thought that far ahead, the interviewer infers that the applicant lacks vision and goals.\nDescribe a major goal you\u0026rsquo;ve set for yourself recently. Give an example of a goal you both set and achieved. Ideally, this should be a professional goal; such as improved time management skills, achieved new performance targets, or learned a new skill. A personal example can also be appropriate if it reinforces your pattern of accomplishments. For example, if you take a great deal of initiative and quickly move into leadership positions, you might use a personal example relating to your recent community work: organized a community walk-a-thon that raised $30,000 in matching funds to purchase new computers for the local library. Talk about results of achieving your goal. This indicates you set realistic goals and that you can focus on outcomes. Select an example that has interesting outcomes related to your efforts. The example should showcase your skills and abilities.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to learn more about us, what would you change about our company? Be careful here. Most companies don\u0026rsquo;t want you to come in and shake up the place. At the same time, they don\u0026rsquo;t want someone who says, \u0026ldquo;Nothing, everything looks great here.\u0026rdquo; Seek a middle ground by focusing on one or two non-threatening issues that may have come up in your discussions. For example, \u0026ldquo;From our discussion of the problem with the southwest accounts, I think we should look into the possibility of consolidating them the LA office. However, I think we need to do a thorough cost-benefit analysis of this region before making such a move. We may find the Phoenix office to be more beneficial.\u0026rdquo; Such an answer indicates you are open to making changes but you also have a certain non-threatening decision-making style. Your response should sound sensible and innovative. \\\nWe all have weaknesses. What are some of your major weaknesses? This is not the time to confess all your problems nor to confidently say you have no weaknesses. The best way to handle this question is to mention personal weaknesses that are outside the job or a professional weakness that you have already improved upon. For example, \u0026ldquo;I have a real weakness for chocolate that tends to go right to my waist! I\u0026rsquo;m watching my calories carefully these days!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never been good with accounting. I\u0026rsquo;m glad this job doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve accounting.\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;I have a tendency to take on too much on my own. I am working on this by delegating more.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat type of decisions do you have difficulty making? Show that you are generally decisive but mention that there are situations that give you time to pause or you are learning how to better make decisions. For example, \u0026ldquo;I sometimes have difficulty choosing between two equally good ideas.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I used to have difficulty saying \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; to people until I learned to better set priorities.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is your biggest failure? Focus on something outside your work or something that happened on the job that you later fixed. Do not admit to any personal quality that might hamper job performance, such as procrastination, laziness or lack of concentration. Choose something that will not reflect badly on your ability to perform in the given position, such as one that took place early in your career. For example, \u0026ldquo;My biggest failure was not being selected as a SEAL because I was diagnosed with night vision problems. When I was 18, all I wanted to be was a SEAL. But I\u0026rsquo;m glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t, because I may have overlooked an exciting career in information technology\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When I was working at CL Advertising Associates, I lost the $2 million Jettler account after only six weeks on the job! I felt awful and thought I would be fired. I was determined to get the account back and did after six months. Today the account makes up 1/3 of CL Advertising.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat are the major reasons for your success? This is not the time to become extremely self-centered and arrogant. Keep in mind that employers are often looking for team players rather than Lone Rangers. A good response to this question may relate to a mentor/and or philosophy of work or the people you work with. Also, use this question as an opportunity to inquire about an appropriate \u0026ldquo;fit for success\u0026rdquo; with this company. For example, \u0026ldquo;Many years ago I learned an important lesson from Bob Nelson, who was my first supervisor and really became my most important mentor. He told me his secret to success was to \u0026lsquo;Look at each day as a new opportunity to be your very best. Set high goals, be honest, never say no, and work with people who share your passion for doing their best.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve always remembered that advice and try to live it every day. I am very self motivated, determined and honest. I really love what I do and I try to surround myself with people who share similar passions. I thrive on this type of environment. Am I likely to find this environment with your company? Can you tell me a little more about the characteristics of successful people at your company? What do you see as some of the key success factors for this position?\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;re considering two other candidates for this position. Why should we hire you rather than someone else? Do not be distracted by the mention of two other candidates, you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about them and they could be fictitious. Focus on what strengths you bring to the table. These should be consistent with the four things most employers are looking for in candidates during the job interview: competence, professionalism, enthusiasm, and likability. Remember, they are looking for chemistry between you and them. Be prepared to summarize in 60 seconds why you are the best candidate for the job. Also, let the employer know you want the job and you will enjoy working with them. A lack of interest in the job may indicate a lack of enthusiasm for the job and them. How do you spend your free time? This question may have several purposes. The interviewer may be just curious about your personal life without getting into illegal questions. He may also want to know how well rounded you are in your personal and professional lives. Focus on some of the standard hobbies or activities that most people engage in: golf, tennis, boating, reading, music, opera, collecting, gardening, or cooking. If you are operating a home-based business as a sideline, you may not want to reveal your entrepreneurial spirit-it may indicate you are planning to leave and go solo as soon as the business starts doing well. Source: Haldane\u0026rsquo;s Best Answers to Tough Interview Questions, Bernard Haldane Associates, 2000. Why do you want to work in this industry? Tell a story about how you first became interested in this type of work. Point out any similarities between the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for and your current or most recent job. Provide proof that you aren\u0026rsquo;t simply shopping in this interview. Make your passions for you work a theme that you allude to continually throughout the interview. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to work in an industry that makes tools. One of my hobbies is home-improvement projects, so I\u0026rsquo;ve collected a number of saws manufactured by your company. I could be an accountant anywhere, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather work for a company whose products I trust.\u0026rdquo; How do you stay current? Demonstrate natural interest in the industry or career field by describing publications or trade associations that are compatible with your goal. \u0026ldquo;I pore over the Wall Street Journal, the Times, Institutional Investor, and several mutual fund newsletters. And I have a number of friends who are analysts.\u0026rdquo; Why do you think this industry would sustain your interest in the long haul? What expectations or projects do you have for the business that would enable you to grow without necessarily advancing? What excites you about the business? What proof can you offer that your interest has already come from a deep curiosity-perhaps going back at least a few years-rather than a current whim you\u0026rsquo;ll outgrow? \u0026ldquo;The technology in the industry is changing so rapidly that I see lots of room for job enhancement regardless of promotions. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in the many applications for multimedia as a training tool.\u0026rdquo; Where do you want to be in five years? Don\u0026rsquo;t give specific time frames or job titles. Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you\u0026rsquo;d expect in your chosen field or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t discuss your goals in a fields or industry unrelated to the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for. This may sound obvious, but too many candidates make this mistake, unwittingly demonstrating a real lack of interest in their current field or industry. Needless to say, such a gaffe will immediately eliminate you from further consideration. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to have the opportunity to work in a plant as well as at the home office. I also hope to develop my management skills, perhaps by managing a small staff.\u0026rdquo; Describe your ideal career. Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you\u0026rsquo;d expect in this particular job or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. Avoid mentioning specific time frames or job titles. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to stay in a field related to training no matter what happens. I was too interested in business to work at a university, but I believe that teaching is somehow in my blood. I\u0026rsquo;ve been good at sales because I took the time to educate my clients. Now I look forward to training the new hires.\u0026rdquo; Tell me something about yourself that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know from reading your resume. Don\u0026rsquo;t just repeat what\u0026rsquo;s on your resume. Think of a talent or skill that didn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit into your employment history, but that\u0026rsquo;s unique and reveals something intriguing about your personality or past experience. \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ve managed my own small portfolio since I was sixteen, but I believe that it\u0026rsquo;s important for you to understand my interest in investment sales. I\u0026rsquo;ve averaged a 12 percent return over the past eight years.\u0026rdquo; Tell me what you know about this company. Describe your first encounter or a recent encounter with the company or its products and services. What would be particularly motivating to you about working there as opposed to working the same type of job in a different company? The recruiter will look for evidence of genuine interest and more than just surface research on the company. Reciting the annual report isn\u0026rsquo;t likely to impress most recruiters, but feedback from customers and employees will. \u0026ldquo;I served as an intern to a restaurant analyst last summer, so I followed all the steak-house chains closely. What you\u0026rsquo;ve done especially well is focus on a limited menu with great consistency among locations; the business traveler trusts your product anywhere in the U.S. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly interested in your real-estate finance group and expansion plans.\u0026rdquo; What have you learned about our company from customers, employees, or others? Describe how your interest has grown from personal dealings with the company representatives. Think creatively in preparing for job interviews. For example, prior to your job interview, speak with retailers or workers at other distribution points about the company\u0026rsquo;s product line. What can they tell you? Give one or two examples of what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to explain why you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this company. What\u0026rsquo;s the most compelling example you can describe to prove your interest? \u0026ldquo;I actually called several of the key accountants mentioned in your brochure. Two of the customers I spoke with explained why they continued to buy from you year after year. Your distribution operation is phenomenal. Are there any service improvements you think could still be made?\u0026rdquo; Tell me what you think our distinctive advantage is within the industry. Describe things you believe the company does very well, particularly compared to its competition. Explain how the financial strength of the company is important. \u0026ldquo;With your low-cost-producer status and headquarters operation in a low-cost area of the country, you seem in a better position to be able to spend aggressively on R\u0026amp;D, even in a down year compared to your closest rival.\u0026rdquo; What other firms are you interviewing with, and for what positions? Often the candidate will try to impress the employer by naming some large firms in unrelated industries with completely different types of jobs. This is a big mistake! What employers want to hear is that you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for similar jobs in the same industry at similar firms (such as their competitors). This illustrates that you\u0026rsquo;re committed to finding a job in your field of interest and are likely to be a low-risk hire. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely decided to pursue a career as a restaurant manager, so I\u0026rsquo;m applying for restaurant management-training programs. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently had interviews with several other large national fast-food chains, such as Super Burger and Clackey\u0026rsquo;s Chicken.\u0026rdquo; Do you believe you\u0026rsquo;re overqualified for this position? Most people don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be asked if they have a great deal of experience. This question could quite easily catch a candidate off guard, which is exactly the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s intention. The candidate doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate in answering this question and shows complete confidence in his or her ability. \u0026ldquo;Not at all. My experience and qualifications make me do my job only better, and in my opinion, my good design skills help to sell more books. My business experience helps me run the art department in a cost-efficient manner, thus saving the company money. Finally, I think I\u0026rsquo;m able to attract better freelance talent because of all my industry contacts. My qualifications are better for your company, too, since you\u0026rsquo;ll be getting a better return for your investment. Again, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in establishing a long-term relationship with my employer, and if I did well, I would expect expanded responsibilities that could make use of even other skills.\u0026rdquo; What would you do if one of our competitors offered you a position? The interviewer is trying to determine whether the candidate is truly interested in the industry and company, or whether he or she has chosen the company randomly. Contrast your perceptions of the company with its competitors, and talk about the company\u0026rsquo;s products or services that you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered. In the long run, which players do you believe are most viable and why? This is also a good place to ask the interviewer for his or her opinion. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say no. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in other players in this industry. I want to work for Nike because I won a number of races wearing the Nike brand. Because of my positive experience with Nike, I know I\u0026rsquo;d be convincing selling your product to retailers.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your dream job? This is your ideal chance to sell your aptitudes that fit the job description. Show an interest in finding new ways these skills can be put to use in a new job with additional responsibilities. Tie in the industry, size of company, or other factors where appropriate. \u0026ldquo;My dream job would include all of the responsibilities and duties in this position you\u0026rsquo;re trying to fill. I also thrive in a fast-changing environment where there\u0026rsquo;s business growth. Your plans call for expanding internationally during the next year, and this would satisfy one of my ultimate goals of being involved in an international corporation.\u0026rdquo; What motivates you to do this kind of work? The interviewer will want to know about your belief in the products or services of the company. Use personal experience to demonstrate your interests and strengths. In an interview for your ideal job, you\u0026rsquo;d be highly motivated to get paid for working at something you liked. The interviewer will want to know if your natural interests are compatible with its particular job. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate in my own schooling; I had wonderful teachers. I want to be that same kind of teacher-who not only encourages kids to learn but also sets an example that inspires others to want to teach. In the long run, that\u0026rsquo;s our best chance of turning around the quality of education in this state.\u0026rdquo; Why should I hire you? Don\u0026rsquo;t repeat your resume or employment history. Offer one or two examples to explain why you\u0026rsquo;re talking to this particular company. What\u0026rsquo;s the most compelling example you can give to prove your interest? This question often remains unasked, but it\u0026rsquo;s always in the back of the recruiter\u0026rsquo;s mind. Even if this question isn\u0026rsquo;t asked, you should find an opportunity to use your prepared response sometime during the interview, perhaps in your closing remarks. \u0026ldquo;My uncle had a company that was a small-scale manufacturer in the industry, and although he later sold the business, I worked there for five summers doing all sorts of odd jobs. For that reason I believe I know this business from the ground up, and you can be assured that I know what I\u0026rsquo;d be getting into as a plant manager here.\u0026rdquo; What are your strengths? Describe two or three skills you have that are most relevant to the job. Avoid clich�s or generalities; offer specific evidence. Describe new ways these skills could be put to use in the new position. If you have to talk about weaknesses, be honest without shooting yourself in the foot-avoid pointing out a weakness that could be a major obstacle in landing the job. For example, it might be wise to mention you barely have the required work experience for the job; the interviewer has surely noticed this much, and then you can explain how you\u0026rsquo;re qualified nonetheless. \u0026ldquo;My strengths are interpersonal skills, and I can usually win people over to my point of view. Also, I have good judgment about people and an intuitive sense of their talents and their ability to contribute to a given problem. These skills seem to me directly related to the job. I notice that you require three years' work experience for this job. Although my resume shows I\u0026rsquo;ve only two years' experience, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t show that I took two evening college courses related to my field and have been active in one of the professional societies. I also try to gain knowledge by reading the industry\u0026rsquo;s trade journals. I\u0026rsquo;m certain that my combined knowledge and skill level is the equivalent of that of other people who do have three years' of work experience. I\u0026rsquo;m also currently enrolled in a time-management course; I can already see the effects of this course at work on my present job.\u0026rdquo; How do you explain your job success? Be candid without sounding arrogant. Mention observations other people have made about your work strengths or talents. This question is similar to the question \u0026ldquo;What sets you apart from the crowd?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I never assume our customers are satisfied with our product, so I do my best to follow up with every customer. This feedback has provided valuable insight into the quality and characteristics of our products. The customer, as well, always appreciates this follow-up, especially when something hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone right and you still have the opportunity to correct it on a timely basis. In addition, I\u0026rsquo;m able to pass on information to our design and production units to help improve both process and product.\u0026rdquo; Would your current boss describe you as the kind of employee who goes the extra mile? Be ready to offer proof that you persevere to see important projects through and to achieve important results. Share an example that demonstrates your dependability or willingness to tackle a tough project. If you describe \u0026ldquo;long hours of work,\u0026rdquo; make sure you demonstrate that the hours were productive, and not just the result of poor time management. \u0026ldquo;Absolutely. In fact, on my annual evaluations she writes that I\u0026rsquo;m the most dependable and flexible person on her staff. I think this is mostly because of my ability to juggle and prioritize. Would you like an example?\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a time you didn\u0026rsquo;t perform to your capabilities. This question forces the candidate to describe a negative situation. Do so in the context of an early career mistake based on inexperience; then demonstrate the better judgment you now have as a result of that learning experience. \u0026ldquo;The first time I had to give a presentation to our board, I failed to anticipate some of their questions. I was unprepared for anything other than what I wanted to report. Now my director and I brainstorm all the what-ifs in advance.\u0026rdquo; How do you manage stress in your daily work? It might be helpful here to describe a stressful project you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on and the specific actions you took to organize each step and see the project through. How do you keep yourself calm and professional under pressure? \u0026ldquo;I try to get out for lunch at least once during the week to clear my head. I also have a personal rule that stops me from reacting to a problem until I feel calm about it. I think, then act-but I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to do that over time.\u0026rdquo; How do you regroup when things haven\u0026rsquo;t gone as planned? Describe a time when some obstacle forced you to change your original plan, but you were still able to achieve the desired result. Did you rally the support of others to make this happen? With hindsight, how might you have better predicted the obstacle? \u0026ldquo;I start by trying to imagine the worst possible outcome; then I back up and identify precautions I can take to avoid that scenario. In this way I usually end up with a result close to the original goal. The training example I described earlier is proof of that skill.\u0026rdquo; Why is service such an important issue? The interviewer is trying to determine if the candidate understands the importance of customer service in establishing a positive image in the marketplace, and its impact on new business sales. Outstanding customer service is also a great help in establishing long-term clients and repeat business-the profitable company\u0026rsquo;s bread and butter. The longer the relationship, the greater the possibility for profit. \u0026ldquo;Service is a major contributor to customer satisfaction. Just as important as, or maybe even more important than, cost. If a customer isn\u0026rsquo;t receiving a level of service that meets or exceeds his or her expectations, that customer won\u0026rsquo;t be a customer for very long. In addition, that customer\u0026rsquo;s experience with your company may affect how potential customers in the marketplace view your company. People do talk and share information. This may affect not only profits but future sales as well. In many instances service may be the one thing that distinguishes a company from the competition. A bad reputation for service may compromise a company\u0026rsquo;s position in the marketplace.\u0026rdquo;\nTell me about a time when you had to deal with an irate customer. How did you handle the situation?\nHow you react when others lose their temper or become upset is very important in most positions, especially those in service industries. The interviewer will be looking for evidence of your aptitude for work that involves a great deal of contact with the public. Give an example of a time when you were faced with a difficult person and how you handled it. Your answer should illustrate your maturity, diplomacy, and awareness of the needs and feelings of others.\n\u0026ldquo;My customer service position at the telephone company involved dealing occasionally with irate customers. When that happened, I\u0026rsquo;d try to talk in a calm, even voice, in order to get the person to respond in a businesslike manner and focus on trying to resolve the situation. Most times I was able to rectify the problem and pacify the customer, but I remember one incident in particular in which the caller became verbally abusive. I tried to remain calm and professional and not to let my personal feelings enter into the situation. I didn\u0026rsquo;t respond to the abuse, I just made a not of it and continued to help he customer as best I could. When the abuse persisted, however, I politely asked him to call back and ask for my manager, because at that point I knew I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t resolve the problem.\u0026rdquo;\nHow do you manage your work week and make realistic deadlines?\nTo answer this question effectively, describe in detail how you establish priorities, set deadlines, and determine schedules. \u0026ldquo;I always reserve two hours of dead time every day to handle any unanticipated problems that may occur. I used to plan for eight or nine hours of project time, but now I find that I\u0026rsquo;m able to manage my own projects, as well as whatever my boss and staff need from me.\u0026rdquo; What personal skill or work habit have you struggled to improve? This question is similar to \u0026ldquo;Describe a professional skill you\u0026rsquo;ve developed in your most recent job.\u0026rdquo; However, here you probably want to discuss an improvement from the earliest days of your career or from your relatively distant past. Make sure you convince the interviewer that this particular work habit is no longer an obstacle. \u0026ldquo;I had to learn to say no. I used to be helpful to the point that other staff abused my goodwill. Now I offer to help by countering with something I\u0026rsquo;d like help on in return. On balance I believe the trade-off is more equitable, and cooperation in our office has improved over time.\u0026rdquo; What color is your brain? Be aware that you\u0026rsquo;ll probably be asked zany questions. The point is not to stump you, but to find out what makes you tick. When the standard interview questions are asked, people are prepared, and it\u0026rsquo;s harder for the recruiter to get to know the real person. An advertising recruiter, for example, tries to avoid this. There is no right or wrong answer to this type of question. In fact, the recruiter won\u0026rsquo;t even really care what your answer is. He or she just doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear something like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s blue because that\u0026rsquo;s the way I imagine it.\u0026rdquo; The point is to see how creative you are and how you think. Be sure to explain why you answered the way you did. \u0026ldquo;My brain is red because I\u0026rsquo;m always hot. I\u0026rsquo;m always on fire with new plans and ideas.\u0026rdquo; If you got on an elevator where everyone was facing the back, what would you do? Interviews in creative fields like advertising and graphic design are different from other types of job interviews. Advertising recruiters tend to have a different interview style and process, usually conducting more of a behavioral interview. Recruiters ask questions like these to figure out what your behavior might be in a particular real-life situation. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;d face the front anyway and say aloud, \u0026lsquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really much more comfortable facing forward, you know.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot; What\u0026rsquo;s the most creative or innovative project you\u0026rsquo;ve worked on? Provide examples of your initiative and resourcefulness. Discuss how your leadership skills have helped you accomplish your goals. Give a specific example that shows a creative, new, or unusual approach to reaching your goals. \u0026ldquo;During my summer job at Cellular One, I noticed that the sales inquiries were distributed haphazardly to all the marketing assistants in the office. I decided to set up a system grouping inquiries according to region or according to company size. This approach enabled the entire marketing team to come up with better and more creative solutions to our sales problems.\u0026rdquo; Consider the following scenario: You\u0026rsquo;re working late one evening and are the last person in the office. You answer an urgent telephone call to your supervisor from a sales rep who\u0026rsquo;s currently meeting with a potential client. The sales rep needs an answer to a question to close the sale. Tomorrow will be too late. You have the expertise to answer the question, but it\u0026rsquo;s beyond your normal level of authority. How do you respond? This response shows that the candidate is confident in his or her ability and can be counted on in an emergency. Similarly, your answer should indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re not afraid to be the decision maker in a tough situation, even if the situation\u0026rsquo;s beyond your normal level of authority. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d get all the pertinent information, taking well-documented notes. I\u0026rsquo;d answer the question based on my knowledge and the information provided. I\u0026rsquo;d leave my supervisor a note and fill him or her in on the details the next morning. I\u0026rsquo;d be sure to explain my decision, as well as the thought process behind it.\u0026rdquo; Give me proof of your persuasiveness. This is a question about leadership, but try not to use an example in which you were the designated leader. If possible, describe a time when you didn\u0026rsquo;t really have authority but instead used your powers of persuasion to get people on your side. Describe your goal and the outcome of your efforts. Why did people trust or believe you? \u0026ldquo;During my summer internship I was assigned the task of conducting a benchmarking study for all the communication expenditures for a major utility. I had to get the consensus of employees in several different departments. Unfortunately, they resented the fact that I was just a summer intern, and they refused to cooperate. I had to schedule individual meetings with every employee and persuade each one that I was doing what would be ultimately to his or her own department and to the company. After a frustrating month, I finally got everyone\u0026rsquo;s cooperation, the project went flawlessly, and in the end I received a bonus for my efforts.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your most productive or ideal work setting? The interviewer wants to know the impact that the candidate\u0026rsquo;s working environment has on his or her job performance. How well would you fit the position, physical layout of the department, and attitudes of the particular work group? Emphasize your ability to work in a variety of settings and how you\u0026rsquo;ve managed to be productive in less-than-ideal work environments. \u0026ldquo;I like having at least one hour of uninterrupted time in the early morning to plan my day. I usually start around 7 a.m. Otherwise, I enjoy an office with open doors, constant feedback, and lots of energy and activity. It helps me work more productively when I sense how busy everyone else is, too.\u0026rdquo; Do you prefer continuity in structure or frequent change in your daily work? Your answer should be consistent with the job description. Describe environments that have allowed you to remain interested and learn new things without getting bored. \u0026ldquo;I enjoy challenge and change, which is why I frequently ask for the tough assignments. The last two projects we discussed were ones that I asked for. I don\u0026rsquo;t allow myself to get bored.\u0026rdquo; What environments allow you to be especially effective? Emphasize your flexibility and your ability to work in many different types of environments. Your answer should not consist of a laundry list of requirements (private office, few interruptions, and so on) or the interviewer may conclude that you will be difficult to satisfy. \u0026ldquo;Although I can work effectively in most environments, I prefer environments where people are their own bosses, within reason. I like to have a goal but be able to draw my own map to get there. To accomplish goals, I rely on asking questions and finding people receptive, so cooperation and access are important to me in a work group.\u0026rdquo; How will you complement this department? Describe how your personality and/or skills would help round out the department. What types of people enjoy working with you for hours at a time? How would the company\u0026rsquo;s customers or clients react? Assure the interviewer that there will be no surprises about your work personality. \u0026ldquo;I enjoy an environment in which people bounce ideas off each other and have the flexibility to ask for help when they need it. I\u0026rsquo;m usually a great troubleshooter for PC problems in my office, and I\u0026rsquo;m often going to ask for help proofreading important memos. I believe in give-and-take.\u0026rdquo; Whom did you choose as your references and why? The interviewer is looking for a logical mix of people without any obvious omissions. For example, a former sales person would do well to include a former salesperson as a reference. Describe what you\u0026rsquo;d expect each of your references to say. Include a diverse group-senior to junior, an associate from work, and old professor from college. \u0026ldquo;I selected a former boss, a peer, and customer as references, to demonstrate that I\u0026rsquo;m a pretty well-rounded person and get along with all the important work associates in my life.\u0026rdquo; Can we call all of your references? This is a question designed to protect you. If your current job employer doesn\u0026rsquo;t know your looking for a new job (as is most often the case), you can request that the interviewer contact your current employer after you\u0026rsquo;ve accepted a position and given your notice to your current employer. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d prefer that you call my current boss only after you\u0026rsquo;ve made me a firm offer of employment and I\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to tell her myself that I\u0026rsquo;m changing jobs. Then, of course, I understand your need to verify that my application was accurate.\u0026rdquo; Are you most productive working alone or in a group? The interviewer is looking for someone who can work in an environment without the environment disrupting the candidate\u0026rsquo;s preferred way of getting work done. Be honest but communicate that you\u0026rsquo;re a flexible and reasonably adaptable employee. \u0026ldquo;I need some privacy time for planning, but otherwise I like the activity and noise of people around me and the ability to share ideas. I think most writers need reinforcement, because we all get writer\u0026rsquo;s block occasionally.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about an effective manager, supervisor, or other person in a leading role you\u0026rsquo;ve known. Talk about a supervisor\u0026rsquo;s management style and interpersonal skills. Focus on the positive-how the person worked rather than what type of work he or she did. How was the person able to accomplish so much and get your support? \u0026ldquo;The best professor I ever had always reviewed the most important points from our last class before he moved on to new material. He also watched our faces carefully and repeated information whenever he saw a blank stare. Sometimes he would just ask for feedback by saying, \u0026lsquo;What are you having difficulty with?'\u0026rdquo; He never assumed too much or made us feel dumb for not grasping a concept quickly.\u0026rdquo; What type of people do you work with most effectively? Focus on the positive here. What type of boss, employee, and colleague would you be? Keep in mind that the interviewer wants to find out how well you would fit in with the other personalities in the company-not how well the other personalities in the company would suit you. \u0026ldquo;I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and am decisive.\u0026rdquo; What things impress you in colleagues? The recruiter will want to see how developed your interpersonal skills are. More than likely, you\u0026rsquo;ll be interacting not only with your own department, but with other people in the company, and possibly colleagues. Show the recruiter that you will shine in this area. \u0026ldquo;I admire and work best with people who are of good character and have integrity. I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment.\u0026rdquo; How do you organize and plan for major projects? Give the interviewer a good idea of your general approach to mastering complex tasks. You may wish to include here how you decide time frames, set deadlines, determine priorities, delegate tasks, and decide what to do for yourself. \u0026ldquo;I love to brainstorm a best, worst, and most likely scenario. Then I set out a timetable that\u0026rsquo;s realistic. What I usually find is that some combination of my best and worst cases evolves; I can adjust my schedule easily as these things unfold because I\u0026rsquo;ve already visualized what could happen and how I\u0026rsquo;d react.\u0026rdquo; What personal characteristics add to your effectiveness? Talk about what makes your personal style unique and effective. For example, how are you able to get cooperation from others? What specific skills and traits help you get results, and why? \u0026ldquo;I always stay in touch with my network. If I see an article that might be of interest to someone I know, I clip it and send it to that person. Then, when I need help and make a phone call to that person, the phone call gets returned promptly.\u0026rdquo; How have your technical skills been an asset? Describe how you\u0026rsquo;ve used technical skills to solve a problem. Tell a specific story. Demonstrate how these same skills have been useful in other situations or in most of the jobs you\u0026rsquo;ve held. If you\u0026rsquo;re hired, what situations will you handle particularly well? \u0026ldquo;Although I never planned on a career as a writer or publisher, much of my job in marketing has depended on good writing and creative layout skills. My part-time college job with a newspaper taught me a lot about desktop publishing, how to position something on a page effectively, and how to write short sentences with maximum impact. In all of my marketing jobs, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to explain my goals clearly to graphic designers, which has helped me avoid costly design revisions.\u0026rdquo; How do you usually go about solving a problem? The interviewer will want to hear the logic you use to solve problems as well as the outcomes you\u0026rsquo;re able to achieve. Are you decisive? How do you narrow the options and make decisions? What do people say about your reasoning skills? What examples would they cite of your effective decision-making? \u0026ldquo;When I need to solve a problem, I generally start by writing down as many ideas as I can think of about possible causes. Next I look for relationships among causes so I can group together symptoms of bigger problems. Usually, after I study these groups of problems, the real cause becomes readily apparent.\u0026rdquo; How practical or pragmatic are you? Give the interviewer an example of some practical or sensible approach you\u0026rsquo;ve used to solve a problem. When was a simple solution the best solution? Had others overlooked the obvious? In this example, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to show off your commonsense skills rather than your academic skills. \u0026ldquo;I can usually pick up on an underlying problem, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not too obvious. I recall an investment banker who visited our real-estate-finance class and asked us what might cause the Tokyo investment community a problem in attracting local investment dollars. A number of finance students in the class started trying to think of some complicated set of reasons. I decided it would have to do with getting out of a bad market quickly, and that a non-liquid investment would create problems. I said investors would be unsettled if the primary investment is local real estate and inflation has caused the paper value to exaggerate the real street value. As it ended up, that was the answer he wanted.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a time when there was no rule or precedent to help you attack a problem. Can you operate without structure? Describe your problem-solving process, especially the steps you took and measures you established in a particularly trying situation. Demonstrate confidence and the willingness to take on more challenges. \u0026ldquo;I was the first employee in a newly created position. I spent the first week developing an understanding of the history that had led to creation of the position. Only then did a method for setting priorities on the job become clear.\u0026rdquo; What\u0026rsquo;s your greatest achievement to date? Be sure that the achievement you describe here is relevant to the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. Also, be careful that your answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound as if the best is behind you. Mention something great that you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved, but clearly communicate your belief that the best is yet to come. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m proud of the fact that I graduated on time with a solid GPA while I played varsity basketball for four years. A lot of women on my team either took a reduced course load or let their grades suffer. I believe the reason I got through it all was sheer determination; I never even let myself visualize anything but finishing on time and with good grades. So I firmly believe, as a professional counselor, in the importance of a positive outlook.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about something you accomplished that required discipline. This is your opportunity to discuss a skill you worked to develop, or a time when the quantity of your work required solid time-management skills. How did you remain focused? \u0026ldquo;I had to work two jobs to put myself through graduate school. I interned at the newspaper while I studied journalism during the week. Then on weekends, I sold real estate. Juggling those three schedules was a challenge, but I did it because it was important to me to graduate without school loans.\u0026rdquo; Where do you hope that your career will have progressed to in the next few years? Avoid the temptation to suggest job titles; this makes you seem unbending and unrealistic, since you don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it might have taken your interviewer to reach certain levels, and you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to insult. Describe new experiences or responsibilities you\u0026rsquo;d like to add that build on the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for. \u0026ldquo;Over the next few years I\u0026rsquo;d like to have progressed to the point there I have bottom-line budget responsibility, and I\u0026rsquo;m also in charge of a production unit where I have labor-relations, quality-control, design, and manufacturing responsibilities. I believe this job will go a long way to helping me meet my career goals.\u0026rdquo; Since this will be your first job, how do you know you\u0026rsquo;ll like the career path? This can be a difficult question to answer convincingly, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve done a little bit of preparation. Discuss, for example, an internship or a conversation that\u0026rsquo;s allowed you to assess the culture of the organization or to preview the work involved. Describe other people in the profession who have been mentors or who have taught you about the field. Also, point out why you\u0026rsquo;re interested, how you learned more about the industry, and how you stay current with industry trends. \u0026ldquo;Although it\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;ve never worked a job in your industry, I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to many friends and alums at my school who\u0026rsquo;ve been successful in your company. I always ask them questions, \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the most frustrating thing about your job?\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the most rewarding thing about your job?\u0026rsquo; From the information I\u0026rsquo;ve gained, I\u0026rsquo;m confident that I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to adapt quickly to your culture and will find the next few years rewarding, based on my goals and values.\u0026rdquo; What are your aspirations beyond this job? Again, don\u0026rsquo;t fall into the trap of specifying job titles. Stick to a natural progression you see as plausible. How should this job grow for the good of the organization? Then turn your attention once again to the job at hand. If you seem too interested in what lies beyond this job, the interviewer will fear that you won\u0026rsquo;t stick around for long. \u0026ldquo;Beyond this job as a marketing assistant, I see myself moving up through marketing analysis into brand management and eventually running a category. I\u0026rsquo;m aware that there are several skills I need to develop in the interval, and I believe with your continuing-education program and my own motivation for self-improvement, I\u0026rsquo;ll have those skills when the opportunities arise for greater responsibility. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m determined to learn from the ground up, starting as a marketing assistant.\u0026rdquo; How long do you think you\u0026rsquo;d continue to grow in this job? This is a variation on the question, \u0026ldquo;Where do you want to be in five years?\u0026rdquo; Be as specific as you can, considering what you know about the position. Don\u0026rsquo;t mention a job title you\u0026rsquo;d want next, or the interviewer will wonder if you\u0026rsquo;re already preoccupied with moving on. \u0026ldquo;My own personal measure of growth in a job is acquiring new skills, new knowledge, and new insights into the industry. As long as I can measure this type of growth, I consider myself successful. I\u0026rsquo;m a believer in stretching a job by reaching out to learn more about other areas that are peripheral to the job I\u0026rsquo;m in.\u0026rdquo; Compare this job to others you\u0026rsquo;re pursuing. Some consistency or thread of commonality among your other prospects is important here. Your choices must reflect your career aspirations. What common skills are clearly needed in all the jobs you\u0026rsquo;re pursuing? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve narrowed my job search to only those large securities firms within the finance industry. The basic skills necessary with all of these firms are similar: strong quantitative and analytical abilities, the ability to make decisions quickly, and good interpersonal skills to react to a customer\u0026rsquo;s needs.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your salary expectations. A well-prepared candidate can effectively turn this question around. Ask first for the company\u0026rsquo;s salary range, then answer in general terms based on your qualifications in relation to the job requirements. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve become a little frustrated in the past year because the downturn in our industry has caused limited promotional opportunities. Based upon salary information published by our national association, the market price for someone with my experience and educational background is in the broad range of thirty to forty thousand dollars per year. Although I\u0026rsquo;m not certain how your salaries compare to the national norms, my feeling is that my value would certainly be in the upper half of this national range. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll share with me some of your salary ranges relative to the national norms.\u0026rdquo; What do you reasonably expect to earn within five years? Again, turn this question around and ask what\u0026rsquo;s typical for the career path. Then consider, based on your skills and performance, the areas you\u0026rsquo;ll excel in. Leave it to the interviewer the appropriate time frames for promotions. Don\u0026rsquo;t speculate, or you\u0026rsquo;ll risk sounding arrogant, unrealistic, or the opposite-too reserved or too tentative. \u0026ldquo;My expectation for the next five years is that my contributions will be recognized and appropriately rewarded. I realize that salary levels are based on a number of factors, including the company\u0026rsquo;s profitability and the general business cycle that affects our industry, but I expect to take on greater responsibility each year and to be appropriately compensated for my efforts and contributions.\u0026rdquo; Other than work, tell me about an activity you\u0026rsquo;ve remained interested in over several years. The interviewer is looking here for a history of commitment over time, and consistency of interests. Do you sustain your hobbies over a period of time, or do you have a different hobby every year? Are your interests compatible with the job you\u0026rsquo;re applying for? Would they be of value in any way to the company? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in Cancer Society fundraising ever since my grandmother died from the disease. In the back of my mind I guess I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the research can lead to findings in time to save the life of someone else in my family.\u0026rdquo; What do you enjoy in your spare time? The interviewer wants evidence that you\u0026rsquo;re well rounded, not just one-dimensional. He or she is looking for shared interests or common ground. You should always, in some way, relate your answer to the job description. \u0026ldquo;I really enjoy getting outside-I often go camping and hiking. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about different fabrics that are good for various weather conditions. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m so interested in your textile operations.\u0026rdquo; Do you live a balanced lifestyle? Do you have an outlet, a way to break from work, so that you show up each day refreshed and ready to perform at your highest level? Describe something specific that allows you to relax. Are your personal and career interests compatible in terms of their logic or thought process? \u0026ldquo;I make an effort to get out of the office at a reasonable hour twice a week. I go home and walk my dog. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the most relaxing things I do, but it often helps me to think of solutions for problems at work, even though I\u0026rsquo;m not consciously trying to solve those problems.\u0026rdquo; What outside activities complement your work interests? The interviewer is interested to see if the candidate\u0026rsquo;s personality is reflected in both work and outside activities. Your answer to this question will shed light on your personality and thus possibly on your compatibility with the job. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed tennis. In many ways it\u0026rsquo;s a game of strategy and pacing. When something isn\u0026rsquo;t working in the first set, you have to change your strategy for the second set. You also have to pace your energy in case you go to a third set, and constantly watch and read your opponent\u0026rsquo;s reactions. I\u0026rsquo;m a gutsy tennis player-I go for the big points sometimes-but I\u0026rsquo;m careful with timing. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I work, too.\u0026rdquo; If you found yourself getting burned out, what would you do to revitalize your energy? Are you disciplined enough to avoid burnout? When you\u0026rsquo;re not being productive, do you recognize it? What do you do to cope with stress? \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t allow myself to get involved in a routine to the point that I get burned out. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been the type of person who asks for new assignments so that I stay motivated and interested.\u0026rdquo; Our company believes that employees should give back time to the community. How do you feel about it? Describe a time you gave something to a community or organization as a volunteer. Do you go above and beyond what\u0026rsquo;s expected of you? Do you use your skills productively? Are you unselfish-a team player? Demonstrate how your personal interests make you productive even when you aren\u0026rsquo;t being paid. What incentives other than a paycheck inspire you? \u0026ldquo;I believe that, too. In my last job as manager I told each of my employees that they could spend one Friday afternoon a month at a charity of their choice on company time as long as they weren\u0026rsquo;t gone on the same Fridays. Ironically, productivity didn\u0026rsquo;t decrease at all; they got more done in the morning-and I guess Friday afternoons weren\u0026rsquo;t that productive to begin with. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent my afternoons with an adult reading program.\u0026rdquo; What community projects that can use your professional skills are particularly interesting to you? This interviewer wants to know if the candidate will be a good corporate citizen. The question also gives the interviewer a sense of the job seeker\u0026rsquo;s values. Try to focus your answer on productive applications of your work-related skills. Don\u0026rsquo;t get sidetracked describing a cause that doesn\u0026rsquo;t demonstrate job-related skills. Avoid discussing any charity or organization that may be considered controversial. \u0026ldquo;As a marketing person, I\u0026rsquo;ve offered free advice to our local high school for its fund-raisers, as well as to a local real-estate office whose success could help my rural community\u0026rsquo;s real-estate values.\u0026rdquo; Describe how a sport or hobby taught you a lesson in teamwork or discipline. Tell about a time you had to use teamwork to get a desired result. Tell a specific story, then explain how the same skill or lesson has been used in your work. \u0026ldquo;My football coach from high school taught me always to watch out for the other guy. If you do, he\u0026rsquo;ll cover you when you need him to. I\u0026rsquo;ve applied that principle in all my work groups, especially on the trading floor.\u0026rdquo; When you aren\u0026rsquo;t at work, do you prefer to stick to a schedule, or do you prefer to be spontaneous? Why? Be careful that, whichever answer you choose, it\u0026rsquo;s consistent with the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. For example, since accounting is a profession that requires discipline and precision, your answer should reflect your natural inclination toward agendas, schedules, and precision. However, for a sales job, you\u0026rsquo;d probably want to show that you\u0026rsquo;re prepared to wing it. This question is essentially about your job personality but is also about your compatibility with the job. \u0026ldquo;My workday is very structured because I\u0026rsquo;m generally in four or five meetings a day. On the weekends, I like to have a plan, but not necessarily a set schedule. That in itself is a relaxing change of pace for me, but I feel I\u0026rsquo;d be wasting time with no plan at all.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about an interest that you outgrew. Describe a former interest or hobby that you no longer pursue, making sure that the interest isn\u0026rsquo;t related in some way to the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. Talk about why you outgrew the interest and how it\u0026rsquo;s not compatible with your current interests. Be sure to discuss how your current interests are related to your career. \u0026ldquo;Early on, I wanted to be a research physician. Then I spent time in a chemistry lab and realized I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking forward to the next two years of lab work. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen marketing for medical equipment instead. It combines my respect for the medical profession with a job that\u0026rsquo;s more suited to my personality.\u0026rdquo; What would you do if I told you that I thought you were giving a very poor interview today? Interviewers like to ask stress questions like these to see how well you hold up under pressure. Your best bet is to stay calm and relaxed; don\u0026rsquo;t allow your confidence to be shaken. \u0026ldquo;Well the first thing I\u0026rsquo;d do is ask you if there was any specific part of the interview that you thought I might have mishandled. After that I\u0026rsquo;d think back and try to remember if there had been any faulty communication on my part. Then I\u0026rsquo;d try to review possible problems I had understanding your questions, and I\u0026rsquo;d ask for clarification if I needed it. Finally, if we had time, I\u0026rsquo;d try to respond more fully and appropriately to the problem areas you identified for me.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your most difficult work or personal experience. The interviewer will want to know how you hold up under pressure. Describe a situation, either personal or professional, that involved a great deal of conflict and challenge and placed you under an unusual amount of stress. What, specifically, were the problems, and what did you do to resolve them? \u0026ldquo;One time my coworker went through rehab for six months after a wreck, and I picked up a lot of additional work to help him out. I know he would\u0026rsquo;ve done the same for me, and it\u0026rsquo;s important for me to have that kind of trust along the members of my work group.\u0026rdquo; If this were your first annual review with our company, what would I be telling you right now? For this question you obviously want to present a positive impression. \u0026ldquo;I wish you would show up on time more,\u0026rdquo; is definitely not a good answer. Remember to focus on one or two of your key strengths based on the personal themes you\u0026rsquo;ve developed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be thanking me for a job well done and would be explaining how you look forward to continuing to see good work from me. Furthermore, I would anticipate your explaining how you really appreciated my putting in extra time on some key projects and how my creative thinking helped come up with some innovative solutions to existing problems.\u0026rdquo; Give an example of a time when you were asked to accomplish a task but weren\u0026rsquo;t given enough information. How did you resolve this problem? Although this example may seem trivial, the candidate demonstrates maturity and an ability to approach work conceptually. The interviewer will want to know that you understand that just getting the job done isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Your response should show resourcefulness and initiative. \u0026ldquo;At my last internship, my supervisor, an account executive, asked me to assemble five hundred press kits for a mailing. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure in what order the pages and press releases should go, but my supervisor had already left for a client meeting. Afraid of putting the information together in the wrong order, I managed to track down her cell phone number and called her in her car. She explained the order of the materials over the phone, and in the end I managed to prevent a mistake that would have cost hours of work and a delay in the mailing-not to mention a few headaches.\u0026rdquo; How have you handled criticism of your work? The interviewer is looking for an indication of the candidate\u0026rsquo;s accountability and professional character. Describe a specific project or work habit that caused you a problem until you faced up to it and overcame it. Alternatively, you might describe a time you responded objectively and professionally to particularly harsh or unreasonable criticism of your work. \u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to keep a good employee once who\u0026rsquo;d been in our manufacturing facility for ten years. His job description was rewritten to require computer skills. I offered to send him to night classes, but he refused the help. I had no option but to replace him. In retrospect if I\u0026rsquo;d encouraged him and other employees to acquire new training periodically, he might not have been overwhelmed by the time his position was reworked. Now I\u0026rsquo;m vigilant about encouraging my group to attend seminars and courses to enhance their job skills and to avoid becoming outdated.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about a situation that frustrated you at work. This is another question designed to probe the candidate\u0026rsquo;s professional personality. The interviewer will want reassurance that you are able to hold up under pressure. Describe how you\u0026rsquo;ve remained diplomatic, objective, or professional in a difficult situation. \u0026ldquo;I was frustrated once when one of my clients, who\u0026rsquo;d insisted on a high-growth stock, called in a panic because the stock price had dropped more than twenty points in one day. I had a hard time convincing him to ride it out rather than cut his losses. This happened despite my attempts from the beginning to explain the short-term volatility of that stock.\u0026rdquo; Tell me about your least-favorite manager or professor. Answering this question will be a bit like walking across a loaded minefield, so be aware! Keep in mind that the interviewer doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to learn about your former supervisors; he or she does want to learn about the way you speak about them. Though the interviewer may bait you to make a negative statement about your former employer, doing so can create a host of problems. Even if your claim is completely true and justified, the recruiter may conclude either that you don\u0026rsquo;t get along with other people or that you shift blame to others. The best way around this dilemma is to choose and example that\u0026rsquo;s not too negative, touch upon it briefly, then focus the rest of your answer on what you learned from the experience. \u0026ldquo;Well I\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty fortunate as far as managers go, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with my professors. In my first job out of college I worked with a manager who was pretty inaccessible. If you walked into his office to ask a question, you got the sense that you were bothering him, so we just learned to get help from each other instead. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say he was my least-favorite manager, because he was a good manager in a lot of ways, but I would have preferred that he\u0026rsquo;d made himself more available to us and given us more direction.\u0026rdquo; Who\u0026rsquo;s the toughest employer you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, and why? Again, you should avoid making negative statements about your previous employers, at all costs. Turn the question around with a positive, upbeat response, as this candidate does. \u0026ldquo;That would be Ms. Henson at Franklin Associates. She\u0026rsquo;d push people to their limits when things got busy, and she was a stickler for detail. But she was always fair, and she rewarded good, hard work. I\u0026rsquo;d call her a tough boss, but a good boss.\u0026rdquo; Time management has become a necessary factor in productivity. Give an example of a time-management skill you\u0026rsquo;ve learned and applied at work. When answering this question, describe a time-management technique you\u0026rsquo;ve applied to work that\u0026rsquo;s allowed you to save time and resources. In such areas as public relations time is precious, and the interviewer will want to see that you have an idea of how valuable your time is. Try to give an example that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve managed to increase productivity because of effective time management. \u0026ldquo;I regularly use scheduling software, which helps me effectively plan for the day, week, month, or year. It also has a to-do-list feature and an alarm option, which is helpful for meeting timely deadlines. In general, though, I\u0026rsquo;m very goal oriented and self-disciplined. I like to focus clearly on one project at a time for a set amount of hours. In the past I\u0026rsquo;ve found that this has helped me save time, which in turn has given me the opportunity to implement new procedures that have ultimately saved the department time and money.\u0026rdquo; Would you be willing to locate to another city? You may, even in some first interviews, be asked questions that seem to elicit a tremendous commitment on your behalf, such as this one. Although such questions may be unfair during an initial job interview, you may well conclude that you have nothing to gain and everything to lose with a negative response. If you\u0026rsquo;re asked such a question unexpectedly during an initial job interview, simply say something like \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s certainly a possibility\u0026rdquo; or I\u0026rsquo;m willing to consider that.\u0026quot; Later, if you receive an offer, you can find out the specific work conditions and then decide if you wish to accept the position. Remember, at the job-offer stage you have the most negotiating power, and the employer may be willing to accommodate your needs. If that isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, you might wish to explain that upon reflection, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided you can\u0026rsquo;t (for instance) relocate but you\u0026rsquo;d like to be considered for other positions that might open up in the future. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to be based here, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly a possibility I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to consider.\u0026rdquo; Would you be able to work extended hours as necessary to perform the job? Your response should match closely the position you\u0026rsquo;re applying for and should reflect a realistic understanding of work and time required. Ask about seasonality of work, if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, and show a willingness to work occasional extended hours. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m accustomed to working long hours during the week. I usually work until at least six-thirty, because I get a lot done after the business office closes at five. I can make arrangements to be available on weekends, if necessary, though I do prefer to have at least twenty-four hours\u0026rsquo; notice.\u0026rdquo; Sell me this stapler. With this kind of question the interviewer will want to determine how quickly you can think on your feet, as well as your ability to communicate effectively and succinctly. Be prepared to give a thirty-second speech on the benefits and advantages of virtually any common office object, from a paper clip to a telephone, particularly if you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for a sales position. \u0026ldquo;This is a professional-quality stapler, designed to be functional as well as attractive. It will help you reduce clutter by enabling you to fasten pages together. And since papers relating to the same subject will now be attached, you\u0026rsquo;ll be more efficient and will save time searching for papers. Finally, its sleek shape and back color are coordinated to match the rest of your office furniture.\u0026rdquo; What is your biggest weakness? This is a great example of what is known as a negative question. Negative questions are a favorite among interviewers, because they\u0026rsquo;re effective for uncovering problems or weaknesses. The key to answering negative questions is to give them a positive spin. For this particular question your best bet is to admit to a weakness that isn\u0026rsquo;t catastrophic, inconsistent, or currently disruptive to your chosen professional field, and to emphasize how you\u0026rsquo;ve overcome or minimized the problem. Whatever you do, don\u0026rsquo;t answer this question with a copout like \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any,\u0026rdquo; or even worse, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any major weaknesses.\u0026rdquo; This kind of a response is likely to eliminate you from contention. \u0026ldquo;I admit to being a bit of a perfectionist. I take a great deal of pride in my work and am committed to producing the highest-quality work I can. Sometimes if I\u0026rsquo;m not careful, thought, I can go a bit overboard. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that it\u0026rsquo;s not always possible or even practical to try and perfect your work-sometimes you have to decide what\u0026rsquo;s important and ignore the rest in order to be productive. It\u0026rsquo;s a question of trade-offs. I also pay a lot of attention to pacing my work, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t get too caught up in perfecting every last detail.\u0026rdquo; Why weren\u0026rsquo;t your grades better? It\u0026rsquo;s likely that if you\u0026rsquo;ve made it to the interview stage, you fulfill the basic criteria for the position, including the education requirements. The recruiter is probably trying to judge here how well the candidate handles adversity. It\u0026rsquo;s important not to get defensive or to place blame. Instead, try to put a positive spin on the question-for example, by concentrating on what you learned and the extra effort you put in, rather than on the grades you received. \u0026ldquo;School was a wonderful experience for me. I really enjoyed learning new ideas, I studied consistently, and I was attentive in class. But I never believed in cramming before the night of an exam just to get a higher grade or staying up all night to finish a term paper. I really believe I learned just as much as many students who went for the grades.\u0026rdquo; Was there a course that you found particularly challenging? The interviewer will want to see how well you respond to difficult situations. Demonstrate that you won\u0026rsquo;t fold in the face of difficulty, and that you\u0026rsquo;re willing to put in the extra effort to meet a challenge. \u0026ldquo;Initially I was completely overwhelmed by the introductory chemistry course that I took last year. No matter how hard I studied, I seemed to be getting nowhere. I failed the first three quizzes. So I tried a new approach. Instead of just studying by myself, I asked a friend who\u0026rsquo;s a chemistry major to help me with my studies. I also began to seek help from the professor after class. And I found that more time I spent in the lab was critical. I ended up with a B-plus in the course and thought I achieved a solid understanding of the material. More than that, I learned that tackling a new field of study sometimes requires a new approach, not just hard work, and that the help of others can be crucial! Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you participate more in extracurricular activities? The interviewer may be worried that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have many outside interests, you may eventually suffer from burnout. Employers like candidates who are well rounded and have interests outside of work. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t participate in formal extracurricular activities in college, you still may want to talk about some of your interests, such as reading or exercising, that you may have a passion for running even if you weren\u0026rsquo;t on the college track team. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to give as much effort as possible to my studies. I came from a high school in a very small town, where I received a lot of A\u0026rsquo;s, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t prepare me well for college. So I studied hard. I have, however, found time to explore the city and make new friends, and I do socialize formally on the weekends.\u0026rdquo;\n [http://www.gowrikumar.com/interview/index.php]\n"},{"id":188,"href":"/posts/25_supervisor_interview_QA/","title":"25 Supervisor Interview Q\u0026A","section":"Tags","content":"What characterize a great supervisor? #  A great supervisor can motivate their subordinates, they go by example, they have good observation skills, and they can utilize the strengths of the people they lead in their teams. Alternatively you can say that great supervisor maintains the highest possible productivity and motivation of the team (or of each team member), and helps the company to achieve their goals on an ongoing basis.\nWhy do you think you can become a good supervisor? #  Because you have the skills and abilities a good supervisor has (mention the strengths from the first answer), because you are motivated to work hard, and because you have experience with similar jobs (if any of that is true).\nAlternatively you can go for a practical answer, narrating your experience with supervising/managing a small team. It can be a working team, a sports club, or even just a group of friends you led (in any kind of circumstances). The goal is to convince us, with the help of a practical example, that you are good at supervising people.\n How would you assess the level of motivation of your subordinates? #  Choosing the right metrics (or goals), and comparing productivity of everyone on a daily basis, is a great answer. You can also say that you would talk to your people regularly, trying to get feedback, and understand whether they are satisfied with their jobs, and motivated to work hard.\nAlternatively you can say that you would compare results of each employee, on a weekly and monthly basis, creating charts and trying to understand their current level of motivation with the help of your data. One way or another, you should demonstrate that you understand the importance of motivation in the workplace, and have a clear idea how to measure and evaluate it.\nWhat do you consider the main goals of a supervisor? #  To maintain high motivation and enthusiasm in the workplace, to ensure everyone works to their full potential, and to take care of any problems that arise in the workplace, or between the workers, such as conflict, loss of motivation, and other problems.\nYou can also opt for another approach, saying that the main goal of a supervisor is to achieve the goals of the company with their team, and say that everything else is secondary, and should arise from the primary goal…\nHow do you handle conflicts with people you supervise? #  You should say that you try to avoid conflicts. But if there is no way to avoid a conflict, or if you fail to avoid it, you will try to understand the perspective of the other person. Eventually you will find a solution that will be good for the entire team–and not only for you.\nYou can also say that you always try to maintain the authority of your position, since if you lost it in a conflict with one of your subordinates, other people from the team might not respect you anymore.\nYou can even elaborate on your answer, saying that you try to organize small team building events for your subordinates (playing bowling, going to the football match, playing some other games, or just drinking in a bar–definitely works in many teams :)), to strengthen a team spirit, which should lead to fewer conflict situations in the workplace.\nSpecial Tip: If you are not sure how to answer these questions in your interview, have a look at an eBook I wrote for you, the Supervisor Interview Guide. Multiple premium answers to 25 interview questions for supervisors, including difficult behavioral (scenario-based) questions, will help you stand out from your competitors, and basically say exactly what the hiring managers want to hear from you. You will find some great sample answers directly on the eBook page, so it makes sense to check it out even if you do not plan to purchase anything. Thank you!\nHow do you plan to go by an example for your subordinates? #  Sticking to the rules, working hard, and even helping with manual labor (if necessary, e.g. when someone did not arrive to work, and you did not have a replacement ready) is a good answer to this question. Another way of going by example (or another approach to this interview question) is saying that you plan to actively participate in everything the team does, including the manual labor.\nYour participation will help you to understand the ins and outs of their work, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of your team members. People always respect a boss who is not afraid to take on manual labor (even if only for a few hours each week).\nHow would you motivate your team members to produce the best possible results? #  Trying to create a competitive atmosphere, trying to motivate the team as a whole, organizing team building events, building good relationships with the workers, ensuring they feel good in work and receive an appropriate reward for their labor, is a great answer to this question.\nShow your interviewers that you know how to work with the laborers, and understand what motivates them to work hard every day.\nCan you define your supervisory style? #  The answer to this question depends on your style of leadership. Do you prefer liberal approach, or do you prefer to maintain a strong authority in the workplace? Either one you choose, you should be able to tell the interviews why you prefer it.\nIdeally you should narrate a situation from the past, one on which you demonstrate your supervisory (leadership) style, and show the hiring managers how it helped you to achieve good results with your team. Alternatively you may say that you are ready to apply both liberal and authoritative approach, and will decide according to the conditions in the workplace, and people you will have in your team. You will simply pick the style that will suit the team you will supervise.\nHow do you imagine a typical day of a supervisor in our company? #  Do not say that you imagine to walk and watch other people working, all day long :).\nYou should try to show your attention to detail, and proactive approach to work, and also your leadership. Say that you will observe the people, trying to spot the problems, and opportunities to improve the work, and consequently the results of the team. Say us that you will always be on the site, and keep an eye on your subordinates.\nYou can also say that you will devote a portion of each day to communication with your subordinates. Asking about the working conditions, and trying to get a feedback on the work they do, and also on other team members, you always try to find the areas for improvement of both working conditions and results.\nWhat do you think about starting a relationship with one of your subordinates, outside of work? Do you consider it right? #  The right answer is yes and no. Good relationships outside of work can help to improve the atmosphere in a team, which nearly always leads to better results. On the other hand, you should not let your emotions to control your decisions in work, and that is hard to achieve if you become emotionally attached to one of your colleagues…\nOne way or another, we are people. You will be neither the first, nor the last boss who started to date one of their subordinates. The key is to convince us that you can make a thick line between your personal and professional life, that your relationships outside of work won’t affect the decisions you will make in your job.\nMore questions \u0026amp; sample answers to all 25 interview questions for supervisors #   Why did you leave your last job? (Why do you want to leave your present job?) Describe a situation when you went above and beyond with your service (for the customer, for the colleague, for your subordinate). Can you tell us something about your working experience? What characterizes a good boss (colleague) from your point of view? Describe a situation when you were under pressure in work. Describe a time when you had to deal with an angry (upset) client or subordinate. What are your salary expectations? Describe a situation when you did not agree with the opinion of your superior, and knew that they were wrong. How did you handle the situation? Describe a situation when you faced a particularly demanding problem or challenge in your personal life. How did that affect you in your job? Describe a situation when you were unable to solve the problem on your own. Describe a time when you struggled to communicate something to your boss or subordinate.

I used gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermalgravimetric Analysis (TGA) to study characterization of polymer materials.  After graduation, I developed skills and experience in chemical analysis and lab accreditation in Total and SGS in China since year 2000.\nWe immigrated to Canada in 2004. I worked at Testmark environmental labs to provide accredited analysis for environmental monitoring and drinking water quality. I developed a GC/FID method for petroleum hydrocarbon (4 fractions. F1: C6 - C10, F2: C10 - C16, F3: C16 - C34, F4: C34 - C50) in soil matrix in compliance with CCME. I was also responsible for quality management and lab operation management.\nAt the meantime, I was also a lecturer at Northern College.\nIn 2009, I joined in AECL at the lab primarily providing analysis for environmental monitoring. I developed and validated a headspace-GC/MS method to determine VOCs in aqueous matrix, and oversaw other method development by following the requirement of lab accreditation. I also developed ad-hoc analysis methods to support decommissioning projects. Meanwhile, I was responsible for quality management.\nIn 2016, I was laid off because the business decided shutting down the lab and contracting analysis.

Although talking about self-proclaimed greatness is something many people find difficult, in an interview, it’s sometimes the only way to make yourself memorable. It’s also the key difference between career progression and career stagnation.\nSo set your inhibitions to one side for the sake of this question. The interviewer has asked it entirely so they can hear about the best version of you – so unless you go completely off topic, you can’t go wrong.\nJust always make sure you prepare in advance. Otherwise, you could end up referring to a recent achievement on impulse, which may not necessarily the best one. And don’t be afraid to include dramatic effects such as results, growth, and transformation.\nRight answer: ‘My biggest success so far has to be last year’s launch of or new range of snack bars – which was the first ever health snack to sell a million units in the UK in under 12 months. After landing the UK distribution deal, I was given three months to gain traction or they’d pull the plug. This wasn’t easy, but through communicating with hundreds of providers, I managed to build enough bridges to make the product take off. We even managed to make a decent profit- helping turn an underdog product into a household name.’\nWrong answer: ‘Yesterday I managed to throw 10 malteasers into my mouth without missing.’\nMy answer: Learn R.\n"},{"id":201,"href":"/posts/Difficult_people_tip_01/","title":"Deal with a Difficult Employee","section":"Tags","content":"Q: Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult employee\nDifficult people are an inevitable part of life – and as a manager, your ability to deal with them in the right way is extra important.\nYou’d be surprised at the amount of useful skills you can demonstrate in answering this question well – as long as you adequately describe the resolution (and its impact), as well as the problem. If in doubt, always follow the STAR technique.\nAnd don’t worry if things didn’t run smoothly. It wouldn’t be a difficult situation if they did. In fact, hiding away from any slip-ups will only make your example come across clichéd. Instead, use them to show how you’ve learnt to better cope in similar situations that may arise in the future.\nIt’s also a good idea to prepare your example in advance – that way you should be able to leave any emotional bias out of it.\nRight answer: ‘I think it’s important to remember that determination can sometimes cause problems – even if the person means well. For example, I once managed someone who constantly met their targets – but their team work ethic was way off. Although they appeared successful, it turned out they were taking leads from colleagues. So I sat down with them to make them aware of the consequences, and stressed the importance of our team targets, rather than trying to work against each other. Not only did they turn things around, they also regained the respect of the team.’\nWrong answer: ‘Well, they’re no longer on my Christmas list, that’s for sure…’\nFive types of difficult employee (and how to manage them) Behavioural interview questions\n"},{"id":202,"href":"/posts/Disagree_with_supervisor/","title":"Disagree With Your Supervisor","section":"Tags","content":"Q: What are some of the things you and your supervisor have disagreed on?\nSituation #1: in hiring a quality officer\nDisagree on:\nI: poor qualification\nSupervisor: better personality\nConsequence: I respected my supervisor.

In other words, it’s never a one-approach-fits-all when it comes to team drive.\nTo let the interviewer know you understand this, explain that you always take the time to get to know your team members in order to understand how they work. Then, talk about how you utilise a variation of techniques based on what suits them best.\nAs always, it’s a good idea to use examples to show how you’ve succeeded at this in the past. Not only will this provide context for the strategies you use, it’ll also prove they actually work.\nRight answer: ‘My main strategies are based around recognising colleagues’ achievements, giving consistent feedback, and providing context for their work – but the ones I utilise most depends on the employee. For example, those who are most goal orientated tend to respond best to understanding the impact of their work, and colleagues that are under-performing are best motivated when given set areas to work on and improve.’\nWrong answer: ‘Blackmail seems to work…’\n"},{"id":206,"href":"/posts/Team_failure_mocking_questions/","title":"A Team Project Failure","section":"Tags","content":"Q: Tell me about a time when a team project failed.

The decision to be made was what companies to profile and how to present the information. Gather the necessary information. Some group members wanted to report on automakers, while others wanted to do electronics firms. We gathered information on both types of company. List all possible choices. We made lists of companies in both categories. Consider possible outcomes for each choice. We decided that a report about car companies could have a positive outcome, but one about electronics firms might be more futuristic with high-tech products such as HDTV, video game consoles, and DVD players. Check out how you feel about each of the choices. Given that this was a group project, we had to consider the feelings of all group members. Relate the choices to your values and priorities. Again, all group members weighed in on their values and priorities. From the possible alternatives, choose one. We decided that we’d do electronics companies because we could bring in products from each company and show what lies ahead. Commit yourself to your chosen decision and disregard the others. Concentrate your energies in one direction. Once we made our decision, we focused all our work on electronics firms. Take steps to turn your decision into positive action. All group members got interested in how the companies were doing. Evaluate your progress from time to time. Change your decision if necessary.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates #  Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax #  Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables #  Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions #  Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes #  When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic #  Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration #  Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals #  If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes #  One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) #  The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters #  Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters #  In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026quot;Permalinks\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2013-11-18\u0026quot; aliases: - \u0026quot;/doc/permalinks/\u0026quot; groups: [\u0026quot;extras\u0026quot;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters #  In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;text-center\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/twitter.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;recent\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":234,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Tags","content":"Step 1.
