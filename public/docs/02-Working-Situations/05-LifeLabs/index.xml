      <description>The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs. I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.
The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Q: We must often work as a team to get a task done and sometimes the members of that team differ from us in temperament or in the way they work.  Tell us about a recent experience in which you were part of team and had &lt;strong&gt;to adapt to working with someone&lt;/strong&gt; despite your differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>While I investigated three hydrolysis approaches, I encountered a problem cleaning up steroids using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method at LifeLabs. Some targeted steroids were lost.
I was recommended using this SPE method which was initially developed for the testing of steroids in serum, but I had to make a new method for my application.
Here is what I did:
 I consulted with a medical scientist to analyze the problem&amp;rsquo;s root cause and come up with solutions.</description>

      <description>Back pressure correction #  There was a time at LifeLabs. The back pressure of a LC-MS/MS was built up over 600 bar. The instrument stopped because the back pressure went up above the limit. I disconnected the UHPLC column from the mass spectrometer. Observed the back pressure reading. The back pressure was still high, so I disconnected the UHPLC column from the guard column. The back pressure dropped. I knew the problem was in the UHPLC column.</description>
