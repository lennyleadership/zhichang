      <description>“Is it important enough to fight about?” #  What you&amp;rsquo;re really doing here is deciding whether the issue is affected by a hard and fast rule or a flexible policy. If it&amp;rsquo;s a shot in the dark, take a moment to see where in the framework it fits the best, if you can. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, just use your best judgment. The next two questions will help you with that.</description>

      <description>Analog: Keep dog fenced in. I am free not to worry about him. He is in his pen. He has stuff in there to keep him entertained and protected. He has food and water. And if he needs something, he will bark to get my attention.
Of course, people are not animals. But the point is instructive.
Everyone should know what they are responsible for.
Everyone should know what is acceptable behaviour with coworkers, customers, and comany leadership.</description>

      <description>John Maxwell said, &amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t care how much you know&amp;ndash;until they know how much you care.&amp;rdquo;
You establish authority not by spouting information and facts with a booming, powerful voice. You do it by cultivating relationships. You do it by letting people know that you sincerely care about their welfare.
Now here are three things that every leader should be the most concerned about.
Focus on three things #  People #  Businesses are great things.</description>

      <description>Here are 3 ways you can overcome the resistance between you and your coworkers and reach an agreement.
  Listen to what she has to say, without judging.
  Respect her enough to see her opinion is as valuable as yours.
  Find the common ground and make your moves from there.
  Moving Forward
You&amp;rsquo;ve listened.
You&amp;rsquo;ve shown respect.
You&amp;rsquo;ve moved toward some common ground.</description>

      <description>Ronald Reagan said, &amp;ldquo;Peace is not the absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.&amp;rdquo;
If you&amp;rsquo;re the leader in your organization, you have given more credit than you are due and more blame than you are responsible for. That&amp;rsquo;s the way people see you.
Three ways you can handle conflict: prevention, discovery, and hitting it head on.
An Ounce of Prevention #  As a leader, you&amp;rsquo;re a lot like a fireman.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re honest, at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll have a coworker you just can&amp;rsquo;t stand.
But since you have to work together, you smile and pretend it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother you at all.
Your Smile is Lying
Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem.
Did you know that your true feelings always show in your voice?
No matter how you try to fake it, if you&amp;rsquo;re angry it will leak out. If you&amp;rsquo;re nervous, your voice will reveal even the slightest quiver and hesitation.</description>

      <description>If you want to lead through resistance, you must see every conflict as an opportunity.
Conflict is Inevitable
The story of Joseph illustrates two great truths.
Conflict is part of life, like it or not.
No matter how well you plan out your life, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t turn out exactly as you planned.
We engage in conflict for three main reasons: #  The first is enforcement of a rule, policy, or standard.</description>
