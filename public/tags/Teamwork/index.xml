      <description>The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs. I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.
The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable.</description>

      <description>While I investigated three hydrolysis approaches, I encountered a problem cleaning up steroids using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method at LifeLabs. Some targeted steroids were lost.
I was recommended using this SPE method which was initially developed for the testing of steroids in serum, but I had to make a new method for my application.
Here is what I did:
 I consulted with a medical scientist to analyze the problem&amp;rsquo;s root cause and come up with solutions.</description>
