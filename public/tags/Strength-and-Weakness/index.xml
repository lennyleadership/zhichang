      <description>Strength: technical savvy.
Weakness:
 there are still lots to learn. Learn programming codes on the job. had few presentation opportunities at work, but practiced the skillset at Toastmasters. syllable missing.
   I have done a self-assessment for data scientists and data analysts.
Strength:
 I am a good listener. I am focused on getting tangible business results with data. no problem of talking in front of a group.</description>
