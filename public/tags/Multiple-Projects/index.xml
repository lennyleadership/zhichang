      <description>&lt;p&gt;EA1.1 You have a validated multi-analyte method currently in use on one LC-MS/MS (instrument A).  You need to have a backup method in place on a different LC-MS/MS (instrument B) so that your team has continuous analytical capabilities in case of instrument issues, technician absences, etc.  Developing the method for instrument B, and training a new technician will involve coordination amongst the two technicians, as well as with the team lead for another group that also uses the same two instruments.&lt;br&gt;
Describe in detail the plan you would use to get the backup method operational so that there is always available analytical capability.&lt;br&gt;
Describe why you include certain steps in your plan, as well as your reasons for the order of steps in your plan.  (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
