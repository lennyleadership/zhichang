      <description>Back pressure correction #  There was a time at LifeLabs. The back pressure of a LC-MS/MS was built up over 600 bar. The instrument stopped because the back pressure went up above the limit. I disconnected the UHPLC column from the mass spectrometer. Observed the back pressure reading. The back pressure was still high, so I disconnected the UHPLC column from the guard column. The back pressure dropped. I knew the problem was in the UHPLC column.</description>
