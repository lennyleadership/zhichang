      <description>Ice-breaking
今天Kevin YIP 跟我做了一个mocking interview。他对我的帮助比Garth和Tony的要更贴近我一些，还是我和Kevin个性比较接近吧。
开场破冰要显得自然些。
This interview will start at 7:30am. I would say something like: Thanks for inviting an interview with you in the early morning. &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; does not mean &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; to me. I am an early person. It does not bother me at all.</description>
