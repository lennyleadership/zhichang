      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between humor that helps and humor that hurts?
Have you ever had someone say to you, &amp;ldquo;I was only kidding? Can&amp;rsquo;t you take a joke?&amp;rdquo; Do you ever feel guilty after laughing at a joke? Have you ever been an evaluator at a club meeting when the speaker used inappropriate humor?
Do you wonder why I am asking these questions? These queries will help us focus on the most important question when it comes to using humor: To tell the difference between constructive and destructive humor, between humor that helps and humor that hurts, between laughing *with* others and laughing *at* others.</description>
