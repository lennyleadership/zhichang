      <description>I once had a co-worker in our section at AECL who procrastinated testing and put team members down to make them look better. As a result, samples that they were responsible for were analyzed beyond the requested holding time. They missed the client&amp;rsquo;s expectations. The team morale went down. Some internal clients chose to subcontract analysis for a better turn-around-time service.
[Ron described it as: the person was not up to the challenge.</description>
