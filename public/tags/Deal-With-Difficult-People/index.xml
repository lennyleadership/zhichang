      <description>Q: what is the most challenging issue?
The person was not up to the task [power hungry, back-stabbing, knew who to do, but procrastinated the work until last minute].

I used to label them difficult people. I saw them as different people now.
really does not matter at all (at the end of the day.)
 Get the job done is complicated, get the job done with empowering people is complex.</description>

      <description>Q: Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult employee
Difficult people are an inevitable part of life – and as a manager, your ability to deal with them in the right way is extra important.
You’d be surprised at the amount of useful skills you can demonstrate in answering this question well – as long as you adequately describe the resolution (and its impact), as well as the problem.</description>
