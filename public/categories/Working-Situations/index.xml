      <title>Chemical Hydrolysis Approach</title>

      <description>The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs. I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.
The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable.</description>

      <description>I once had a co-worker in our section at AECL who procrastinated testing and put team members down to make them look better. As a result, samples that they were responsible for were analyzed beyond the requested holding time. They missed the client&amp;rsquo;s expectations. The team morale went down. Some internal clients chose to subcontract analysis for a better turn-around-time service.
[Ron described it as: the person was not up to the challenge.</description>

      <description>approved timecard.
To ensure we have a consistent approach on the use of sick leave for medical appointment.
HR has advised that sick leave should be used for the time spent at medical appointment and the travel time to and from the appointment only (normally 1 to 4 hours). If the employee decides to take the remainder of the day off, it must be pre-approved and it should be recorded as personal leave (banked time taken, personal business, vacation).</description>

      <description>While I investigated three hydrolysis approaches, I encountered a problem cleaning up steroids using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method at LifeLabs. Some targeted steroids were lost.
I was recommended using this SPE method which was initially developed for the testing of steroids in serum, but I had to make a new method for my application.
Here is what I did:
 I consulted with a medical scientist to analyze the problem&amp;rsquo;s root cause and come up with solutions.</description>

      <description>Back pressure correction #  There was a time at LifeLabs. The back pressure of a LC-MS/MS was built up over 600 bar. The instrument stopped because the back pressure went up above the limit. I disconnected the UHPLC column from the mass spectrometer. Observed the back pressure reading. The back pressure was still high, so I disconnected the UHPLC column from the guard column. The back pressure dropped. I knew the problem was in the UHPLC column.</description>

      <description>huddle meeting, cross-training. The technologist A was asked to train the technologist B on ICP. Both of them did not get alone. Technologist A insisted that technologist B can&amp;rsquo;t run the routine sample until they are proficient.
Karen suggested to train technologist B on QC samples. What did I do to train Kent on GCMS? Karen addressed the matter rather than conflicts.</description>

      <description>Randy and Chantelle always sent emails ahead of me or Karen. It made me annoyed. It seems they were running the show. Power hungry.
As Pamela indicated that I do not have to be the contact point of the group, but I am responsible for the corrective actions when they are arisen.</description>

      <description> I think you will definitely get more buy in from the team if you say you are there to help facilitate getting things done and removing obstacles FOR them. They need to see you as a great resource that assists them in the common goal, as opposed to an authoritative leader with a title. - Pamela Yule
