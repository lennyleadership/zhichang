investigate chemical hydrolysis approach.
The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs. I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.</description>

      <description>Q: What has been your biggest success so far in your career?
Good news – you’ve just gained temporary clearance to blow your own trumpet. Although talking about self-proclaimed greatness is something many people find difficult, in an interview, it’s sometimes the only way to make yourself memorable. It’s also the key difference between career progression and career stagnation.

      <description>Q: Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision, but didn’t have all the information you needed.
Sample excellent response:
I had to make a decision recently between two configurations on one of our routers. Time was quickly moving away from me, and I had to have all the equipment back up in a matter of minutes. I chose the configuration that I had the most data on because I knew at least that I could better troubleshoot it if there was a problem.</description>

      <description>Q: What strategies do you use to motivate a team?
The most important thing to remember when answering this question is that you should always have more than one strategy.
Everyone has different work styles, personalities, and performance levels, meaning how they respond to motivation differs too. In other words, it’s never a one-approach-fits-all when it comes to team drive.
To let the interviewer know you understand this, explain that you always take the time to get to know your team members in order to understand how they work.</description>
