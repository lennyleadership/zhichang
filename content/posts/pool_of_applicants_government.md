Hi,  
I had applied in 2021 for Digital Communications Positions, Web and UX positions posted by the Government of Canada. I went through the exam, interview and reference check process and was told that I was placed in a pool. This would honestly be my dream job. Unfortunately, I haven’t heard back since few months now and I’m really unsure of what is happening with my job application. I was wondering if any of you would be in the same situation. As any of you received a job offer, since having been placed in the pool?

- Pools are valid for a year normally and can be extended  
- I have been in pools where I get an offer within a week or 2 while others had to be extended till it was cancelled  
- You have to keep applying, typically if you screen into one then there are many others you can screen into especially under this Trudeau’s government.

This is a regular practice in the government. Even if you pass an interview, they may still keep you in a pool, but may not offer you a job in the end. As they say, getting into the government is hard, but once you're in, you really have to do something bad to lose your job.  

Don't worry about it too much. If you're in the pool, there is a high chance you will get an interview at one point or not. Most government department runs very incompetently.  
When I got hired, it took close to 1.5 years. From application to being in the pool to interview to security clearance to onboarding. P.S - from the interview to onboarding was almost a 6-8 months gap for me, if I remember correctly.

Pools are usually created at the end of a competitive selection process. The hiring department often has one or more positions to fill, and anticipates that they might have more to fill in the next little while. So they advertise for a "pool", assess a bunch of people, and qualify candidates for the pool. They can then pull those (fully or partially; language levels and security clearance are often not assessed until the position is staffed) assessed candidates to staff open positions as needed. By assessing a bunch of people at once and retaining their information and assessment details, they can more quickly staff vacancies while the pool remains valid. The expiration date on the pool should have been communicated at the same time that you were notified of qualifying for the pool.

Depending on how long ago you qualified for the pool, it's quite possible that they've staffed their open positions already; your name remains in the pool in case a new opportunity that fits your skill set comes open in the future.

Keep applying for other jobs.

But, make note of the pool number. Many departments can pull directly from an already assessed pool. If a different department needs to fill a role that closely matches that of a pool elsewhere, they can literally just pluck a candidate from that assessed pool without bothering with a huge assessment process. It's much quicker, and some hiring managers seek out active pools instead of running a full competitive process themselves.

What classification was on the job poster?

Note: We currently have a pool for my classification at my agency. It closed last year. A couple dozen candidates were fully assessed and qualified, but only 4 or 5 positions at most were actually staffed.

Hi.

Does a partially qualified pool fall under an "already assessed pool"?

I'm an external candidate and recently qualified in a partially assessed pool. The only things not assessed are language levels, reference checks, and security clearance. But, in the email saying I qualified, they asked for references. Is this a pool a different department can hire me from? Or do I need to have security clearance and language levels (if needed) to be pulled by a different department?

Also, "language levels and security clearance are often not assessed until the position is staffed", does this mean a hiring manager reaches out for an interview and decides to hire you, and then language levels and security clearance are assessed? Meaning, they only ask for these assessments when you basically get the position/letter of offer?

For the first question, correct. Partially assessed usually means they've done a written evaluation and interview (the hard parts) and often reference checks, but haven't done the security clearance or language testing as those have finite expiration dates - and during COVID, some methods of second language evaluation have only been useable at the department ordering them and aren't transferable.

For the second, yup. HR usually doesn't want to waste time on security clearance and language evaluations, which have expiration dates, unless they plan on putting the candidate in the position. Interviews are often done as part of the partial qualification though.

Language testing can take a couple months (oral test waitlists through PSC are 8+ weeks right now), and secret or top secret clearance takes a while too. Realiability is usually quick - 2 weeks or so.

Thank you for the info!

Side question if you don't mind, do you know if some pools don't require written evaluations? In my application, I wrote responses to screening questions, but there was never a formal written test. I am now partially qualified and was told that hiring managers may contact me for an interview.

I'm wondering if a hiring manager contacts me, is it likely that I will have to write a test? Or for some pools, there's no test, and the interview is the last stage?

TIA

I'm actually not sure. Every process I've been involved with as an ENG, from either side of the table, has required a written evaluation followed by an interview.

I came across your post and the situation you were in is very similar to what I am going through now. I'm curious to find out what ended up happening...did you ever land the job?

I applied for a position with CRA back in March (2022). I was invited to write an exam in May. I was then invited to participate in a virtual interview in July. My references were requested in August and contacted last week. Now I am waiting to see if I will end up in a pool, hired, or ...??? Does anyone on this forum have an insight into what the next steps may be in this process?
