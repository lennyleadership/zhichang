Jim Millar: Steve, if `r em("culture", "blue")` is a big part of successful teams. how do you try to instill culture in your teams? what's the most difficult part? and what do you do when it's not successful? 

Steve Gladstone: Well I think you know it's the obvious thing. It really comes down to `r em("people", "blue")`. and who are the people that you're supporting for admission? and you want those `r em("people", "blue")` who love the sport deeply. It's not work. they love it, they enjoy it and they have the capacity to work with other `r em("people", "blue")`. I mean the another word that I'd use in this `r em("relationship", "blue")` which seems how would you call it almost flip. it's got to be `r em("fun", "blue")`. and if you now if you look at the energy and that Yale boathouse the over these past five or six years it's wonderful. today is a perfect example of that that way or that element that `r em("culture", "blue")` you know we had five recruits on campus, we interviewed them. or at the end of that 48 hour process we bring them to the armor room and Davenport and we ask them if they have any questions and thoughts and how the weekend was. and to the man. They said they were just really drawn to the spirit of the group. They said during practice the energy how they `r em("bond", "red")` after practice and it's just they're working their `r em("butts off", "blue")` and at the same time there's a lightness to it and a good energy to it how do you bring it about? attract people of that nature and that's what we did. you don't change. when people talk about a change of `r em("culture", "blue")`. it's rare.in my experience. that that `r em("culture", "blue")` has changed without a significant change in in the `r em("people", "blue")`. 

Jim Millar: Steve, Leadership is critical. it's critical on a rowing team. You've been involved in many different universities where I'm sure the selection for captain each year has been different. Any thought you have on the the best selection process? and which has resulted in the best captain selections on a consistent basis?

Steve Gladstone: At most of the places that I've coached, `r em("the captain has played a very very very small role", "red")`. Yale, it's very different and I think that's just a tradition that exists at Yale throughout all their athletic programs. In fact, that subject came up in our first head coaches meeting three days ago. Yes it Yale. it's an important piece. and a good captain, you know, can certainly, how would you call it, expedite or enhance a good `r em("culture", "blue")`. That's for sure and I must say, the last, this is sort of a personal level in the last couple of years, at three years at Yale, it's been extraordinary with Rob Earned, Paul Jaco, and Sholto Carnegie. yeh absolutely exceptional. but basically it's the energy of the group. its individual energy and very often the energy is coming from people that are not, yeh not necessary the captain.
