## Have goal(s) / vision(s)

Goals could be our challenges to be overcome.  

Goals could be the next level of greatness.  

## How do we get there / How do we achieve the goal?

### 1) Plan ahead  
&nbsp;&nbsp;short term and long term,  


### 2) build a team  
“If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together" African Proverb”  by Paul Oberschneider  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 relationship management,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 build up people/team, the score will take care of itself,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 conflict management,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4 realign our routine job to the goal.  performance management to measure performance.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 get staff involve in some collective decision-making process.  

How should a team function?  
[example: rowing, metaphor, less friction, more power, ]  

How to motivate:  
Principle: Motivate them the way as if they would expect to be motivated.
at AEL:  
1) double wage during weekend. [it is extrinsic incentives.]   
2) redeployed staff to develop their potential. [Hannah is a socializer.]
at AECL:  
[Relater] Their needs were met, their contribution were valued.  They sought recognition. [Ken is an example.  Ken is 'relater' type of employee.  He cared about relationships with others.]  
[Thinker] [Ernie is an example.  He expected leadership, he likes to find solutions.]  
[Socializer] [Chantelle is an example.  So gave her presentation opportunity.]  
[Director] [Randy is an example.  He did what he said when lab was relocated to a new building.  He did not care what Chantelle had done.  The only thing I did not agree was his venting the bad decision/behaviour the managers had]
[I want intrinsic rewards.  interesting, challenging work, and th opportunity to achieve and grow into greater responsibility]

[Manage up my boss] [example: provide business analysis to manager]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;skills I would use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;communication

[Plan for dealing with conflicts]

### 3) Task perspectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 Execution, follow-up, and monitoring, 
weekly huddle meeting, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 What are the road blocks?  
3.2.1 procrastination: not motivated.  solved it by setting up performance expectations and monitoring.  



### 4) Look inside: become a great leader,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Characters/ traits: plan ahead, commitment, be fair, be persistent.  
My strength: I discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it.
My reputation: a reputation for being good with people.  
Build trust in relationship with managers. [example: provide solutions to problems to manager]  
Build trust in relationship with coworkers. [example: reduce ]

&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of leadership styles have I used?  I have many leadership styles without notice, such as:  
1) coaching style [example: observation and coaching to correct findings].  
2) democratic style [example: 6-port valves on GC/MS, decision-making when short of one staff].  
3) pacesetting style [example: work with Randy Herman].

I am not coercive as much as I though I was, because the coercive style is extreme top-down decision making, and it kills new ideas on the vine.  I am not determined as much as I thought I was.


### 5) What have I contributed to the team?
[example]: communication: Data visualization at LifeLabs



## Prepare it from taking challenges/ troubleshooting perspective.
Supervision is a challenging journey. challenges in relationship management, to motivate staff who did not care (work for pay-cheque)
What did I do? be fair, recognize achievements, hold myself accountable, build up people,

Supervision is a leadership opportunity. Role models passed legacy of leadership to me, influence me. I now build up people, influence people, make marks in career.


## How to lead a team successfully?

1) personal commitment to the team and to the company.  Hold myself accountable for the success.  Set up high expectations to the team.  
2) Be patient, be persistent.  
3) form an ally.  
4) Build up people, and score will take care of itself.
