## Have goal(s) / vision(s)

Goals could be our challenges to be overcome.  

Goals could be the next level of greatness.  

## How do we get there / How do we achieve the goal?

### 1) Plan ahead  
&nbsp;&nbsp;short term and long term,  


### 2) build a team  
“If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together" African Proverb”  by Paul Oberschneider  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 relationship management,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 build up people/team, the score will take care of itself,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 conflict management,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4 realign our routine job to the goal.  performance management to measure performance.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 get staff involve in some collective decision-making process.  

How should a team function?  
[example: rowing, metaphor, less friction, more power, ]  

How to motivate:  
Principle: Motivate them the way as if they would expect to be motivated.
at AEL:  
1) double wage during weekend. [it is extrinsic incentives.]   
2) redeployed staff to develop their potential. [Hannah is a socializer.]
at AECL:  
[Relater] Their needs were met, their contribution were valued.  They sought recognition. [Ken is an example.  Ken is 'relater' type of employee.  He cared about relationships with others.]  
[Thinker] [Ernie is an example.  He expected leadership, he likes to find solutions.]  
[Socializer] [Chantelle is an example.  So gave her presentation opportunity.]  
[Director] [Randy is an example.  He did what he said when lab was relocated to a new building.  He did not care what Chantelle had done.  The only thing I did not agree was his venting the bad decision/behaviour the managers had]
[I want intrinsic rewards.  interesting, challenging work, and th opportunity to achieve and grow into greater responsibility]

[Manage up my boss] [example: provide business analysis to manager]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;skills I would use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;communication

[Plan for dealing with conflicts]

### 3) Task perspectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 Execution, follow-up, and monitoring, 
weekly huddle meeting, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 What are the road blocks?  
3.2.1 procrastination: not motivated.  solved it by setting up performance expectations and monitoring.  



### 4) Look inside: become a great leader,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Characters/ traits: plan ahead, commitment, be fair, be persistent.  
My strength: I discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it.
My reputation: a reputation for being good with people.  
Build trust in relationship with managers. [example: provide solutions to problems to manager]  
Build trust in relationship with coworkers. [example: reduce ]

&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of leadership styles have I used?  I have many leadership styles without notice, such as:  
1) coaching style [example: observation and coaching to correct findings].  
2) democratic style [example: 6-port valves on GC/MS, decision-making when short of one staff].  
3) pacesetting style [example: work with Randy Herman].

I am not coercive as much as I though I was, because the coercive style is extreme top-down decision making, and it kills new ideas on the vine.  I am not determined as much as I thought I was.


### 5) What have I contributed to the team?
[example]: communication: Data visualization at LifeLabs






## Prepare it from taking challenges/ troubleshooting perspective.
Supervision is a challenging journey. challenges in relationship management, to motivate staff who did not care (work for pay-cheque)
What did I do? be fair, recognize achievements, hold myself accountable, build up people,

Supervision is a leadership opportunity. Role models passed legacy of leadership to me, influence me. I now build up people, influence people, make marks in career.

2) Be patient, be persistent.
