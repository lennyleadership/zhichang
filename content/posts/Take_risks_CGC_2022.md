EC5.1 Describe a situation when you took a calculated risk on a work project for measured gains.  Describe what you did during the situation.  Describe the impact of your actions and overall outcome.  Explain why you chose this example.  (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks] 

Please provide the contact information for someone that can corroborate your response.  

The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs.  I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes.  The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers.   All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.  

The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable.  What did we do?  A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps.  Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis.  I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step.  <a class = "hovertip" tooltip_text = "first line &#10; second line
third line">Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol</a>.  

We did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further.  It was the risk.

My team lead and I decided to take a chance.  I read through lots of literature, designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis with solvolysis, and methanolysis, set up instrument configurations, and ran experiments.  To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late to work around the medical lab technologists' schedule using the automated SPE station.

I managed to finish the project within two months.  The project proved that the solvolysis approach was the best way to cleave steroid conjugates.

This example demonstrated:
1)	my commitment to the team's success
2)	I never settle down but always seek better solutions.
