## CRA
A group of qualified candidates, established following an advertised staffing process, who may be eligible for appointment.

Hiring managers may create a pool if they anticipate a need to staff more positions in the future, and they may also allow other managers to use the pool to staff similar positions.

If a pool is created, the hiring manager must tell you if you have been put in the pool, the effective date of the pool, and the duration of the pool; however, if you have not been placed in a pool, the manager is not obligated to advise you of this.

In some situations, a pool may not be created. If that is the case, the staffing process ends once appointments have been made.

### Public Service Commission of Canada
Hiring from existing pools is an effective and efficient way to staff. Hiring managers can save time and resources by selecting qualified candidates from pools that were established by their own, or another, organization.   

When a hiring manager makes an appointment from an existing pool, they must decide whether it is an advertised or non-advertised appointment.   

When making this decision, managers are encouraged to keep in mind the principles set out in the Preamble of the Public Service Employment Act.  They are also encouraged to consider the information that was in the original job advertisement, such as the merit criteria, job location, hiring organization, job tenure, and group and level.
