**<font color =#3fb5bd>Ice-breaking</font>**  
今天Kevin YIP 跟我做了一个mocking interview。他对我的帮助比Garth McGinn, Tony Fraser 的要更贴近我一些，还是我和Kevin个性比较接近吧。  

开场破冰要显得自然些。

This interview will start at 7:30am.  I would say something like: Thanks for inviting an interview with you in the early morning.  "early" does not mean "early" to me.  I am an early person.  It does not bother me at all.
