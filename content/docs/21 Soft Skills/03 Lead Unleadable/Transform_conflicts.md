If you want to lead through resistance, you must see every conflict as an opportunity.



Conflict is Inevitable  

The story of Joseph illustrates two great truths.  

Conflict is part of life, like it or not.  

No matter how well you plan out your life, it probably won't turn out exactly as you planned.

## We engage in conflict for three main reasons:

**The first is enforcement of a rule, policy, or standard**.  

If it's important enough, it's worth fighting for, isn't it? So what is the yardstick that determines whether or not something is important?     

Your organization's mission statement.  

Unless you have one, it's hard to really know what's important. When you fight for something that's important only to you, you come off as a dictator. But when it's a well-known standard, you stand a better chance at being seen as a fighter for the good of everyone.   


**The second reason we fight is to set a new standard**.  

There's always the chance that someone will come along and push a boundary that hasn't been pushed before. Your mission statement is a more general guide when this happens. As a leader, your maturity and good judgment will be your best weapon in this fight.

And when you're done, you've got the precedent to set a new standard. 


**The third reason we fight is to grow**.  

When we grow from children into adults, we experience pain and bouts of awkwardness. Young people who are adult-sized don't have the experience to match their appearance. Lessons can come from a classroom, which isn't guaranteed to be pain-free. Or they can come from experience, which often has no mercy for the uneducated. Either way, you can choose to learn and be better next time. Or you can sink into bitterness and learn nothing, leaving yourself to experience the same pain again.  

New ideas and procedures will meet resistance. If you've already decided it's important enough, brace yourself to do the tough things required to make it the new normal. But also be prepared to extend the grace that is required for a new way to be universally accepted.


## Communicate Clearly   

Conflict often comes with verbal challenges.  

How can you be sure you don't make the conflict personal and abusive? 

**First, make use of "I" statements**.   
This is a page out of every assertiveness training manual in print. For example, rather than say, "You make me angry", you would say, "I feel angry about this." Or you could say, "I feel angry about the way you handled this." So, instead of placing the blame for your feelings on her, you take ownership of your feelings.  

Then you'll have a chance to talk freely. 

**Second, don't characterize someone's arguments**.   

Don't try to read into something someone says. Don't assume you know what she's thinking. Repeat what you heard and ask her if it sounds like what she meant.  

The temptation when you're angry is to do the opposite. You might want to call her a babbling idiot. You might wish she'd just die of a sudden heart attack. But remember, she's as human as you are. So give her a shot at making a difference for good. 

**Third, listen intently**. 

The biggest temptation when an argument is flaming like a fiery furnace is to insert your own agenda with no consideration whatsoever for the other person's opinion.    

It takes a ton of patience and self-control to do the opposite.    

If you want an argument or discussion to move forward, everyone must have his say. Otherwise, you might as well just make all the decisions yourself and just enforce them on everyone else.    

But then **you'd be dictating instead of leading**.    

Leaders are listeners. They listen because they are learners. And since you can only learn so much from yourself, you need other people to make you sharper.  

So let others have their say â€“ and listen intently.


## **When It's All Over**  
Fires don't burn forever. If you leave them unattended, they die out. If you pour fuel on them, they stay alive.  

When you have a conflict, do your best to keep it short.  

When it's over, you need to clean up quickly.     

There are two reasons for this.  

**First, you clean up quickly to maintain the relationship you had with the other person**. Sure, the conflict probably ruffled a few feathers. But apply the outside of the sandwich approach. Help her to see after that bad experience that you are there for her, you'll give her the help she needs, and that you too will be having the same growing pains.  

**Second, you need to follow through on any promises you made**. Do this quickly or you'll lose the momentum you got all bloody to put into motion.  

And if you keep your word, everyone will know you are serious.  


## **Now Do This**  
Margaret Heffernan, bestselling author and businesswoman said, "For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate."
