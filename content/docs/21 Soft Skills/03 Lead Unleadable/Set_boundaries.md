Analog: Keep dog fenced in.  I am free not to worry about him.  He is in his pen.  He has stuff in there to keep him entertained and protected.  He has food and water.  And if he needs something, he will bark to get my attention.

Of course, people are not animals. But the point is instructive.

Everyone should know what they are responsible for.

Everyone should know what is acceptable behaviour with coworkers, customers, and comany leadership.

Everyone should know what is expected of him.  

Don't assume people know these things. Remind them. Write it down somewhere so it can be easily referenced. Have it available when there is a question or a dispute.   

And if you encounter something new, have the flexibility to change the rules, if necessary.   

Your people need to know what decisions they can make on their own. And when a decision reaches beyond one's authority, have a process in place where that person can make a proposal to you. Of course, the decision is ultimately yours as a leader. But giving them some responsibility to think it through can save you valuable time, especially if the idea turns out to be a good one.
