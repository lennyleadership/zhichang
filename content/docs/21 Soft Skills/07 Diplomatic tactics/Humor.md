You probably are diplomatic enough already whenever you ask someone “How are you?”, not that you really care to know but it is the polite thing to say.

That reminds me of the story about these three wealthy Southern Belles, sipping mint-juleps under a magnolia tree and conversing about their anniversary and what were the gifts they received from their respective husbands.

The first one said, nonchalently thrusting her hand forward, “My husband offered me a diamond so big and heavy that I can barely lift my hand.”

“Oh! That’s nice”, said one of the other ladies.

The second one chimed in: “My husband offered me 6 Cadillacs, one for each day of the week and a Rolls Royce for Sundays, all in different colors, matching my favorite dresses.”

“Oh! That’s nice”, repeated the same lady.

As she did not add another word, the diamond and cars ladies enquired “What about you Peggy Sue, what did your husband offered you for your anniversary?”

“Well, my husband offered me a six-month stay in a very exclusive finishing school in Switzerland.” she answered.

“A finishing school? And what is that?” the two other belles exclaimed in unison.

“Well, a finishing school is a place where they teach you to be really lady-like.”

“And how is that?” asked the two others.

“Well, a finishing school is a place where they teach you to say “Oh! That’s nice” when you actually want to say “Who gives a flyin’ f**k!”…

That’s what being diplomatic i.e polite, could entail. As is my using *** in writing f**k instead of writing “fuck”…

Finally, let me offer you one definition of diplomacy. Diplomacy is telling someone to f**k off and go to hell in such a way that he/she actually looks forward to the trip…

Stay strong.
