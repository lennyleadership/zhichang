Q: 3.  Please give me an example of a situation where you changed your behavior or approach according to the circumstances and the people involved.

or Q:  
We must often work as a team to get a task done and sometimes the members of that team differ from us in temperament or in the way they work.  Tell us about a recent experience in which you were part of team and had **to adapt to working with someone** despite your differences.  

[LifeLabs]
The team lead is obsessed with Excel. They requested consistent concentration unit, volume unit, color pattern on cells for concentration, volume, calculated value, non-calculated value.  As a result, the Excel sheet was colorful. They were not happy when they found out that I did not follow 'his rule'.  I do not have particular rule, so I followed the rule, keeping them happy.
