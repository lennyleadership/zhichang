# Introduction

My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  I started with the quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, petroleum hydrocarbons[^1] <a class="marginnote">F1 (purge and trap), F2 - F4 (Soxhlet extraction)</a>  with GC/FID and GC/MS, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, and conductivity.  When the business was sold, I became the transitional manager to run the operation.  I helped to reduce turn-around-time, implement LIMS, reorganize the structure.


While I worked at the lab, Northern college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  


I accepted the job offer as the chemist in the Analytical Science Branch (ASB) at Whiteshell in 2009. It was my first work to recommission a GC/MS. A senior technologist retired in 2010 and there was an issue with GC/MS. No one was trained to run it. It prevented us from providing organic analysis to the internal clients, including your group. I took the initiative to re-commission the instrument, developed the method and validated it, and got the CALA PT passed for volatile organic compounds. We resumed the testing service within six months.  When the ASB was merged with the environmental monitoring and protection branch, I was delegated to oversee the ASB section where I was, mainly responsible for non-RAD analysis. I met with my manager every week.  


My job at AECL was done in 2016 because our non-RAD section was dissolved.  I went to self-learn R programming language, and figured out many applications in laboratory setting. While I got the job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I implemented these applications to monitor quality trends. Moreover, I conducted troubleshooting for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  The job was done due to the supply shortage of enzyme and loss money of the assay.




# Summary
Visay, I think you are at the stage of setting up team goals, and forming team.  I have variety of skills and lots of potential to help you achieve the team goals in aspect of improving efficiency and effectiveness of lab operation, meeting customer requirements, 

With my skills and experience in field sampling, sample preparation, instrumental analysis, data processing, database, report review, and quality management, it seems to me that I can offer skills and experience that the team is looking for. I can build trust in relationship, build credibility, adapt/ fit in the new team real quickly.

I can help the team work smarter rather than harder, more fun.



# Quote
Better to light the candle than curse the darkness.

# Trust in relationship
As a result, I built credibility, built trust in relationship with the management, and was delegated to oversee the lab operation.  I also built trust in relationship with peers, and work together like allies to address challenges.
