# Introduction

My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  I started with the Quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, F1 (purge and trap), F2 - F4 (Soxhlet extraction) with GC/FID, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, and conductivity.  


While I worked at the lab, the community college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  


I accepted a job offer as a chemist in the Analytical Science Branch (ASB) at AECL in 2009. My first work was re-commissioning of GC/MS, my last work was oversight of the lab operation.  In between, 1) I supported the continual improvement in quality assurance and quality control; 2) assisted in the troubleshooting of instrumentation; 3) acted on audit; 4) administrated LIMS; 5) reviewed and authorized certificate of analysis; 6) streamlined data processing and implemented a balance interface program; 7) commissioned a portable liquid scintillation counter.


The job at AECL was done in 2016.  One thing that I did not have a chance to do at AECL was how to do proactive instrument maintenance so that the lab can reduce instrument down-time. I figured it out during the layoff time while I learned R.  While I accepted a job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I quickly implemented tools in practice. Moreover, I conducted troubleshooting of sample preparation for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  Although MLT jobs are unionized, scientists are allowed to do routine works, I performed experiments, from sample preparation, through the instrumentation, and to the data interpretation.  The job was done due to the supply shortage of enzyme and loss money of the assay.


While I am looking for an opportunity to return to work, I developed a troubleshooting logbook prototype based on my experience at LifeLabs to manage the troubleshooting records.


I have been working in the laboratory setting for 15 years.  I developed variety of skills, including wet chemistry analysis, data analysis, quality control and quality assurance.  It seems that I could help with 




build trust in relationship with management.
# Summary
I have versatile skills, I am capable to oversee all aspects of laboratory operation: field sampling, sample preparation, instrumental analysis, data processing, report review, quality management.
