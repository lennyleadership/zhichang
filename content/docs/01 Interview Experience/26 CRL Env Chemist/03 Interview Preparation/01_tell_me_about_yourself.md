# Introduction

My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  I started with the quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, F1 (purge and trap), F2 - F4 (Soxhlet extraction) with GC/FID, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, and conductivity.  


While I worked at the lab, the community college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  


I accepted the job offer as a chemist in the Analytical Science Branch (ASB) at AECL in 2009. A senior technologist retired in 2010 and left a GC/MS behind, no one was trained to run it. It prevented us from providing organic analysis to the internal clients, including environmental monitoring group. I took the initiative to re-commission the instrument, and get the CALA PT passed for volatile organic compounds. We resumed the testing service.  There were many little moments like that when I stood up to help the team.  As a result, I built trust in relationship with the management, and was delegated to oversee the lab operation.  I also built trust in relationship with peers, and work together with allies to address challenges.


My job at AECL was done in 2016.  I went to self-learn R programming language, and figured out many applications in laboratory setting. While I accepted the job offer as the lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I quickly implemented these applications to monitor trends. Moreover, I conducted troubleshooting of sample preparation for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  The job was done due to the supply shortage of enzyme and loss money of the assay.


I have been working in the laboratory setting for 15 years.  I developed variety of skills, including wet chemistry analysis, data analysis, quality control and quality assurance, and research and development.  I can bring my skills and experience on board at this position.



# Summary
I have versatile skills, I am capable to oversee all aspects of laboratory operation: field sampling, sample preparation, instrumental analysis, data processing, report review, quality management.
