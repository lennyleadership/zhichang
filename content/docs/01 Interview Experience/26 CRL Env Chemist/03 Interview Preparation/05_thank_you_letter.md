Thank you all for meeting with me during the interview.  It was such a pleasure bringing up the good old time when I visited CRL.

Besides what I shared with you, I want to share one situation about my work ethic so that you would get to know me more.

It happened when the Whiteshell management announced the lay-off of lab employees in six months.  A couple of junior technologists did not think it was necessary to finish up the revision of a couple of standard operating procedures.  Randy Herman and I teamed up to motivate them to maintain a high level of professionalism no matter the circumstance.  We got the job done.

I wish I could convince you that I am the best fit for your branch.  

I am looking forward to hearing from you the positive feedback.
