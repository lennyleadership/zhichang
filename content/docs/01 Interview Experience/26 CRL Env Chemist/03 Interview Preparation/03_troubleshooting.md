## At high level  
It is a critical step to diagnose problem.

Good practice of reducing problem and diagnosing problem:  

1) The best performance of instrument as a reference  

2) Monitoring:
&emsp;2.1) instrument parameters
&emsp;&emsp;such as EMV of GC/MS

&emsp;2.2) internal standard 

3) Use fish-bone diagram as a tool for isolating / breaking down the system  

4) troubleshooting records documentation  

5) maintenance logbooks


When diagnosing problem:  

The problematic location could be easily identified in some cases based on previous experience.  It is a nice-to-have tool to have troubleshooting records documentation.  

In other cases, the problematic location are not easily identified, then we could use fish-bone diagram, and we could leverage many resources, such as brain storming with co-workers, vendor technical support,  user group forum.

case #1: layout current batch against previous batches


When solving problem: 

take one small step at a time.
