Is it a new position?  Was there a chemist before?  

What is the branch mission?  

My understanding of the rule:  

1) proactively improve chemistry processes  

2) Perform trend evaluations

3) Develop and maintain understanding of sampling and analytical methodologies  

4) Produce technical documentation

5) Drive improvement in sampling and analytical methodologies



The rule won't:

1) review report

2) be accountable for quality plan  

3) be delegated  



What types of instrument are there?  

What does the unionized environment look like in the team?

what does the regular day look alike for the Chemist?

What do you expect me to do?

How does the Chemist interact with the team?

How does the chemist function in the operation?
