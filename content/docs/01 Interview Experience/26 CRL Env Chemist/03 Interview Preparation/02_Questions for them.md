It seems to me that the chemist role in the branch is an <mark class = "lemon">assisting</mark> role, 

I assume the chemist review all data.

Was there a chemist before?  

What types of instrument are there?  

What does the unionized environment look like in the team?

what does the regular day look alike for the Chemist?

What do you expect me to do?

How does the Chemist interact with the team?

How does the chemist function in the operation?
