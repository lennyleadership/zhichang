After finishing the take-home exam, I told my friends that I felt I have been working in the company for a probation period.  I encountered every-day scenarios and provided solutions to them.  

When answering a screening question "Do you have experience supervising staff", I referred to a quote "Build up people, the score will take care of itself".  The football coach, Bill Walsh, said that.

I wish I could persuade you successfully that I am a good fit to this position.  



I would like to take this time to make a summary about me and my mindset of supervising a team.


Thank you for inviting me to the assessment process up till now.
