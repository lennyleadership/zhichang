When I was the lab manager at Testmark.  I fired a technician because he did not do testing on a weekend that was scheduled.  The reason was he was drunk the day before in the evening.

background: nice person.  I had every reason to do so, because he had performance issues, the company took actions of discipline, sent out letters of disciplines, but there were no changes in behavior.  


what would I do differently?  
I would take opportunities to work with him, know his performance, 
Give myself an opportunity to help him.  It does not mean I want to be nice.  

Like what I did to an technologist at AECL. Although this technologist at AECL had room for improvement, 
documented

How I see my position differently.

Hi Lenny! It is so good to hear from you!! Things are going well at work and in my personal life.
I am now Customer Service Manager for all 5 labs in Ontario and responsible for the Customer Service Reps and Bottle Order Technicians in all locations…busy busy!! Lol

Mitch hasn’t changed much….we actually rehired him a few years later for another position and he did the same thing…never showed up, was drunk a lot and missing work. I ended up firing him a second time and he has never gone back to work since then, still unemployed. 

Don’t feel bad. He has to make a choice to have a good life, no one else can do it for him
