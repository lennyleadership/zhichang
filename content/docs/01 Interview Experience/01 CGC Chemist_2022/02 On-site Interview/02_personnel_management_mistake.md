I was just appointed as the lab manager when Testmark bought out Accuracy Labs.  A technician did not show up to do testing on a weekend that was scheduled.  I fired him.  I had every reason to do so, because he had performance issues due to drinking issue, Accuracy took actions of discipline, sent out letters of disciplines, but there were no changes in his behavior.

When looking back, I would give myself a time to help him at work.  Firstly, I knew little about him in the past.  The information about him came from coworkers.  It was not fair to have opinion about coworkers from others. I would build relationship with him.  Secondly, I would begin with discipline process, monitoring his progress closely.  Thirdly my understanding about the supervisor roll has changed since working at AECL.  

Care about people, I

Hi Lenny! It is so good to hear from you!! Things are going well at work and in my personal life.
I am now Customer Service Manager for all 5 labs in Ontario and responsible for the Customer Service Reps and Bottle Order Technicians in all locations…busy busy!! Lol

Mitch hasn’t changed much….we actually rehired him a few years later for another position and he did the same thing…never showed up, was drunk a lot and missing work. I ended up firing him a second time and he has never gone back to work since then, still unemployed. 

Don’t feel bad. He has to make a choice to have a good life, no one else can do it for him
