I used to believe in the management mindset of the previous CEO Jack Welch, "leaders should fire the bottom 10% of their workforce each year, as part of an orderly continuous improvement process." I practiced that when I was managing the lab at Testmark.  A technician did not show up to do testing on a weekend that was scheduled.  I fired him.  I had every reason to do so, because he had performance issues due to drinking issue, Accuracy took actions of discipline, sent out letters of disciplines, but there were no changes in his behavior.

My mindset has changed since I joined in at AECL.  I adopted the philosophy of "build up people, the score will take care of itself."  I think it works in Canadian culture.  That does not mean being nice always, it means be fair with employee. There are unlimited means to provide constructive feedback if the leader cares about people as long as the employee makes a choice to have a good life and improve their performance.  I believe people come to work together for reasons.  It is not coincident. 

I found that the struggling in life could affect the work performance.  Looking back, I did not know much about his past. I would give myself a chance to know him, walk through with him just I did for the employee at AECL.

Hi Lenny! It is so good to hear from you!! Things are going well at work and in my personal life.
I am now Customer Service Manager for all 5 labs in Ontario and responsible for the Customer Service Reps and Bottle Order Technicians in all locations…busy busy!! Lol

Mitch hasn’t changed much….we actually rehired him a few years later for another position and he did the same thing…never showed up, was drunk a lot and missing work. I ended up firing him a second time and he has never gone back to work since then, still unemployed. 

Don’t feel bad. He has to make a choice to have a good life, no one else can do it for him
