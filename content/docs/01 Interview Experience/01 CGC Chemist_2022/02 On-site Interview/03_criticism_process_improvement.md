Case #1:

Many years ago when I sat down with an internal client during a coffee time at AECL.  He told me that they sent samples to a contract lab because they knew we can't provide good turn-around-time service.  There was no overnight solution to this problem.  I began with conducting business analysis.  I broke down the operational concerns into two areas for improvement that we can do. 1) The first area was everyone's accountability.  I set clear expectations in the performance appraisal that the team can commit to.  I also set a goal they strive to achieve. I held them accountable by monitoring the progress. It was a good start.  2) The second area was to save us from tedious and repetitive data analysis.  I developed several data processing programs using VBA.  a) One program helped the team to work around the problem with LIMS and generate batch list. b) one program helped a technologist to report VOC results. c) One program helped the QA officer generate QC reports. d) One program helped me review data.  The benefit was obvious.  a) The data quality on report was improved, no typo, no calculation errors.  b) Time was saved, for example, the VOC reporting from scratch to the end was saved from four days to a couple of hours. c) I was not panicking in dealing with multitasks.

Why it was the most useful criticism? 1) It opened my eyes to see where we were for a team, and set the goal we would reach; 2) It became a catalyst to make positive change to the group.

>In general, <u>improvements in clarity of communications</u> will go a long way.  The aim of the assessment is for a candidate to clearly demonstrate their knowledge of the essential criteria and that they consistently display the essential abilities and competencies.  My advice is to consider the audience when you are crafting your responses – particularly their knowledge, experience, familiarity with the topics at hand, etc.
