My definition of employee's success is they enjoy what they are doing, and they see the value in what they are doing.  The way I did to make them success is recognition, and recognition comes in different forms.  I would like to share two situations.


The first situation happened at Testmark where I was the lab manager.  It was the business transition period, the team was reorganized.  I redeployed one technician from the position in the lab to the customer service rep because she had experience in testings, and her ability to make people connect.  There was potential in her.  It turned that she thrived at the new position, today she is the customer service manager managing customer service reps at 5 facilities across Ontario.

The second situation happened at AECL where I was the Chemist. The story started with solving a conflict with the employee.  I took a proactive approach seeking his feedback on how I could do differently down the road.  Luckly enough, he began with providing feedback, then telling his struggling in his life.  We came closer in relationship.  Later on, I looked into performance of each individual technologist.  I collected data.  I realized he was the top performer all the time.  I sent an email to the branch manager providing data to support that this employee exceeded expectation for his performance appraisal.  My voice was heard, and his performance was valued.  He showed his support to me while I dealt with the most difficult situation.  When the section was laid-off, he asked me to become his reference while he was looking for job.
