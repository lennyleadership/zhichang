K.P.I. of operation:

5) Get pipette calibrations check (11 out of 12 on time).

How did you decide to select these as goals?  
1) address concerns,  
2) know where they are at presence, where they are going to go in future.  

Organization:  
To what extent did you meet them?  How did you measure whether or not you met them?
Because they were set with S.M.A.R.T. approach.
