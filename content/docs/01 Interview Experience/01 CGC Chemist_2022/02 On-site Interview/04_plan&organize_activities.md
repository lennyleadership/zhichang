Our section was suffered from productivity at AECL for a couple of years. I tracked the analysis flow for a couple of years. In the first year when I was delegated to oversee the lab operation, I approved technologist's timesheets, so I had statistics on time they spent to different aspects.  I consolidated data for each technologist performance.  I had a clue on where we were at now, and what aim we could reach at.  Therefore, when I was asked to set the performance objectives, I knew what I should put on.  I also understood I should not expect too much. I came up with the team's goals and individual goals on top of objectives at the branch level.  I had meeting with each one going over the list, and had mutual agreement.  The goals were measurable, so the performance could be measured.

mid-year performance review. follow up during huddle meeting.


How did you measure whether or not you met them? Because they were set with S.M.A.R.T. approach. [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound]
