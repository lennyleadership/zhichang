EA1.1 You have a validated multi-analyte method currently in use on one LC-MS/MS (instrument A).  You need to have a backup method in place on a different LC-MS/MS (instrument B) so that your team has continuous analytical capabilities in case of instrument issues, technician absences, etc.  Developing the method for instrument B, and training a new technician will involve coordination amongst the two technicians, as well as with the team lead for another group that also uses the same two instruments.  
Describe in detail the plan you would use to get the backup method operational so that there is always available analytical capability.   
Describe why you include certain steps in your plan, as well as your reasons for the order of steps in your plan.  (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks]

I assume I would lead the project, and a technician would develop the backup method on instrument B.

Many factors could affect the project and its success.  They could be:  
-	The reality of the timeline to complete the work  
-	The scope of work  
-	The impact on our routine analysis and routine analysis of another team  
-	Coordination within the team and with another team who also uses both instruments  
-	Assign the work to a technician.  Redistribute the workload of the technician who will set up the backup method.  
-	Constrains in supplies (such as samples, columns, standards, and so on)  
-	The teams who I need to collaborate with (such as IT, Quality, and Sampling)  

Here is the scope of work: 
-	Develop and validate the method on instrument B
-	Verify analysis on both instruments by running some identical batches and comparing data
-	Train the new technician
-	Setup the backup method on LIMS with the IT group support
-	Documentation with the Quality group support:
Such as the standard operating procedure,  method development and validation data, technical training and proficiency, verification testings results
-	Prepare a summary report

Each item in the scope of work starts when one item above it is done, so they are listed in a chronology order.   

I will prepare a draft plan on a Gantt chart, including all scope of work.  

Firstly, I will meet with three technicians because I need their input to solidify my plan and know any possible obstacles.  In the meeting, I will ask the technician in my mind to take the job.  We will discuss: 1) how we redistribute the workload among the other two technicians, 2) any concerns that I need to discuss with the team lead of another team due to the conflict with their testing schedule, 3) a pragmatic timeline and the scope of work, 4) various resources needed.  It is a good idea to use a separate column for the backup method even though it is identical to the current column on instrument B to reduce interference to routine analysis.

Then I will discuss this plan with the team lead of another team.
 
Thirdly, I will discuss with the representatives of the IT group and the Quality group how they support us, what they need from us, and when we need them. 

Throughout these meetings, I will modify the plan.

Lastly, I will present the summary to my manager, finalizing the plan.

During the routine, I will update the Gantt chart and make it available to the team, solve concerns and conflicts when needed, and keep some key stakeholders updated on progress.  I will come early or stay late, accompanying the technician for some time.

I expect the project will end with a celebration!  A company-wide recognition award is proposed for the achievement of every stakeholder.
