EA1. Ability to plan complex work tasks that involve coordinating with multiple stakeholders.

EA1.1 You have a validated multi-analyte method currently in use on one LC-MS/MS (instrument A).  You need to have a backup method in place on a different LC-MS/MS (instrument B) so that your team has continuous analytical capabilities in case of instrument issues, technician absences, etc.  Developing the method for instrument B, and training a new technician will involve coordination amongst the two technicians, as well as with the team lead for another group that also uses the same two instruments. 
Describe in detail the plan you would use to get the backup method operational so that there is always available analytical capability.  
Describe why you include certain steps in your plan, as well as your reasons for the order of steps in your plan. (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks]



EA1.2 This position will involve managing multiple people and multiple projects.  Describe a situation at work where you demonstrated your ability to manage simultaneous work tasks that had multiple people relying on the outcomes. (Maximum 500 words.)  [10 marks] 

Please provide the contact information for someone that can corroborate your response.

In your response, describe:
The techniques or tools you used to manage the tasks.  
How you managed expectations of the people relying on the outcomes.
How well the tasks were completed and how you evaluated the quality of the outcomes.
What you would do differently next time.
What you would continue to do next time.
Why you chose this example to demonstrate your competency in planning, organizing, and coordinating.

EK1. Knowledge of good laboratory practices.

EK1.1 Your group has been requested to evaluate a new method that will be used to ensure grain complies with an industry specification set by companies that purchase Canadian grain. List the general steps you would take to prepare and perform the evaluation to guarantee the method performs well. Describe your rationale for each step.  (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks]





EK1.2 Name and discuss three strategies that you would use to ensure quality data are generated during a 2 year survey of grain for various chemical contaminants. Provide a rationale for why you chose these strategies. (Maximum 500 words.)  [6 marks]




EK2. Knowledge of sample preparation principles for organic contaminants in complex matrices at sub-mg/kg concentrations.

EK2.1 Offer a possible solution for each problem scenario.  Provide a rationale supporting your proposed solution. (Maximum 300 words.) [8 marks]
•	A. The relative standard deviation of the mean recovery of analyte from naturally incurred sample being evaluated for use as an in house reference material is 53%
•	B. Recovery of analyte from a fortified matrix being evaluated for use as an in house reference material is > 130%.
•	C. Analytes in the middle of a GC-MS analytical run co-elute with, and are obscured by, fatty acids.  Samples (5 g) were extracted with dispersive-SPE (50 mg PSA and 150 mg MgSO4). 
•	D. An LC-MS/MS method for an early eluting, small polar analyte in oilseed samples is not showing the same sensitivity as one month ago. 


EK2.2 During the initial stages of method development, 63 ± 23%   (mean ± standard deviation of 5 test portions from one soybean sample) of pre-extraction fortified analyte appeared to be recovered from soybeans. The method involved aqueous extraction of grain with LC-MS/MS analysis. Describe two possible causes of the observed low recoveries, and propose a strategy for how to improve recoveries for each of the two possible causes.  (Maximum 300 words.) [4 marks]

a.	Injector temperature is too low for GC-MS method.
b.	Dwell time is too short in selected ion monitoring mode.
c.	Guard column is dirty.




EK3.2. Consider a situation at work when there was an issue with your chromatographic-mass spectrometric instrumentation that you solved. Describe the symptoms that indicated there was an issue.  In chronological order, describe the steps you took to investigate the issue, diagnose the cause, and correct the problem.  (Maximum 400 words.) [8 marks]
