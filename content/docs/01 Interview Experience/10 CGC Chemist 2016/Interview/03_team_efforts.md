Response:  
Some people tend to think we just knock down one task while we finish an achievement.  However there are more factors involved while we were doing a task.  For example personality.  Recently we were updating an operating procedure.  While I review the procedure, I found out that a reference was not located in a mentioned share area in the reference section of the document.  The document index indicated that the reference was written in 2007.  I sent an email to QA officers and the author with regard to this issue in the first place.  The IT Service Desk confirmed that they could back up files 30 days old.  There is no chance we can restore the document.  The QA officers had no idea where the reference is located somewhere else.  I talked with the author of the reference.  He found the pdf copy in his computer, but there is no document index on it.  There were many ways to get things done.  It was my easy solution to assign a document index to the reference, and upload the reference to the company document system.  The author of the procedure suggested attached the pdf as an appendix.  I shared my thought to the author of the reference, but he insisted on looking for the hard copy with the document index on it first.  Different ways showed that we were different.  There is no I in team.  I gave a bit of time to look for the hard copy.  The section head, administrative assistants, QA officers, and record room staff were involved. It took about a couple of days and we still could not find the hard copy.  At the end, I re-proposed my suggestion to the author of the procedure and the author of the reference.  They all agreed with my idea.  The operating procedure was approved.  
It is a team spirit build up process from my perspective while we together accomplished tasks.
