	1. Real-time response  
	Learned VBA  
	Did administrative works.  
		 
	2. Things need to be improved  
		 
	3. Organized response  
	When I was Chemist at AECL, my primary responsibilities were: 1) development and validation of analysis method; 2) technical support to analysis, assurance and control to the data quality.  I have done a couple of things which were beyond my primary responsibilities.  
	
	First of all, I saw the need of streamlining data processing and data review.  I went and took the training of VBA.  I put data compiling, calibration curve equations, uncertainty calculation equations, and warning of data which are off the calibration curve into the programming codes.  It saved us tones of time in data processing and review so that we could do more and we were not panic when we had extra things to do for laboratory audit.  
	
	Secondly, I took the initiative to do administrative works, such as chemical consumable purchasing, and interacting with trades for lab maintenance, so that analysts can focus on their analysis and deliver results in a timely manner.  
	
	Thirdly, I learned to setup KPI of laboratory operation, and monitored them to improve lab performance and motivate analysts.  
	
	Fourthly, I took opportunities to conducted observation and coaching.  
	 
	As an outcome, I helped to accomplish team goal.
