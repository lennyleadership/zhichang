Q16	Sometimes, it we rush, we can make mistake or overlook a mistake. Tell us about a time that you made a mistake or had a poor result, but avoided further error by rechecking or reviewing your work? (maximum 500 words)  
Please consider in your response:  
o	What was the activity, a test?  
o	How complex or routine is this activity?  
o	How many people were involved?  
o	What caused your concern allowing you to notice the issue?  
o	What steps did you go through in rechecking?  
o	What would be the impact if it wasnâ€™t caught?  
o	How often could this happen?

Response:  
We cannot avoid making mistakes in job, but we could prevent mistakes from happening again in future.  It is what quality assurance is all about.  Continuous improvement makes us do work better.  In February 2016, we failed one volatile organic compound during a proficiency test (PT). I could not find error before we submitted results.  I investigated with the technologist during the root cause analysis.  We could not find anything wrong with the instrument.  I asked help from Agilent Service Center.  A service rep suggested overlaying the compound peak of the PT run with the compound peak from last PT run.  That solved the problem.  There is no such compound in the calibration stock.  There was a mistake when purchasing the calibration stock.  I usually compare the peak areas in the current run at a concentration level against the peak areas from the previous run, but I overlooked it this time because we were short of time.  I documented it in our quality improvement system for trend in future.
