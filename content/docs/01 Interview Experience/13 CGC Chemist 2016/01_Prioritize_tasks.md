Response:  
The priority of work tasks lines up with the branch objective.  We serve internal clients primarily.  The branch set clear expectations about turn-around-time of analysis, the priority of analysis from different clients, the requirements of accreditation and regulation.  I prioritize my tasks according to these expectations.  I have a list of performances every year.  They are set for the performance appraisal at the end of the fiscal year.  
I setup routine tasks and reminders on the Outlook calendar, such as the weekly toolbox meeting with lab staff, monthly work load update, monthly fire inspection tour, quarterly logbook inspection, and monthly section meeting.  
Whenever analysis reports and QC reports are submitted to me for approval.  I put down other tasks, because I committed to finished reviews within a couple of days.  
Safety is a big deal in our laboratory.  When a safety issue came up, I had to response immediately.  
When any analysis were required urgent service, we all communicated with each other, so collective effects were put to the urgent task.  
At the end of the fiscal year, my section head and I reviewed the performances.  We evaluated how well I aligned with the branch objectives; how well I set up the priority; what would be priorities and performances for the next fiscal year.
