**DEFINITION**  
Demonstrates one's respect for and appreciation of people from various backgrounds and of varying viewpoints.  It also involves a commitment to the equitable treatment of all employees by recognizing, acknowledging and valuing individual differences and needs through the principles of acceptance and accommodation.  

**QUESTIONS**  
In order to meet the requirements of the lab quality program, your supervisor asks you to check the analytical records of one of your colleagues.  You realize that your colleague has made several errors in his record.  You meet your colleague to explain your observations and he **coldly** replies that these observations are not errors but rather a misinterpretation on your part and that anyway you have no power over him and that he can deliver his results as he sees fit.  What would you do in this case?  

The following questions are provided to guide you in your response.  You donot have to answer them individually.  

1) What action would you take in this type of situation?   
2) How would you address this situation if the varying opinion is due to a different in culture? 
3) How would you manage this situation?  
4) What elements would you take into account?  
5) Generally speaking, how would you handle this type of situation?  

**RESPONSE**  
[Actions]  
1) approach him one on one.  
2) listen him.  
3) explained my observations.  
3) elements: sex, age, education, and emotion  
4) talk to the supervisor.  
[General] Respect, be open-minded.

**Revisit**  
[2022.09.29] (firstly I do problem solving part). I want to work with the colleague to solve the problem.  I would get to know their perspective.  I would want the colleague to explain interpretation from their perspective, and understand their point of views. I wish we would come to the agreement. (secondly I report to the supervisor). If it was not the case, I would bring it to the supervisor's attention.  I would lay out the discrepancy of both observations and interpretations.
