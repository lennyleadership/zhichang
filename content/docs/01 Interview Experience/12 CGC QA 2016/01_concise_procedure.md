**Procedures on how to avoid this happening again**  
As an immediate corrective action, the RCMP shall send a reminder to the public about be aware of the security of their properties.  
It is proposed that the RCMP evaluate the necessity of installing It is proposed that surveillance cameras in the public area where crimes happened frequently.  The signages of surveillance cameras shall be posted in the public area.  The camera presence would help to stop teenagers from break-ins because they would know they are watching.  
A preventive plan starts with identification of the problem(s).  The RCMP is responsible for conducting root cause analysis. The vehicle owners, the Medical Clinic owner, the neighborhood, the suspects, and the suspect families will be involved in the investigation.  The RCMP would need to open up similar cases from the tracking system when possible for the root causes and the preventive actions.  The following questions would assist to identify the problem(s).  
•	What should the significant level of these incidents be?  
•	How did the two teenagers break in the vehicles? Were the vehicles locked?  
•	How did the two teenagers break in and enter the Medical Clinic?  
•	What did they do for?  
•	Were the two teenagers involved in drugs?  
•	What do behaviors and characters of the two teenagers look like?  
•	What challenges are the suspect families facing?  
•	Is there Neighborhood Watch program in place?  If so, the RCMP evaluates the performance.  
It is the residents’ expectation that they do not want to see these two teenagers violate the laws, and they do not want to see other teenagers break the laws.  The preventive plan would not be successful without the community commitment.  The RCMP will take the lead of the plan.  A RCMP staff will be assigned to be responsible for identifying, tracking and implementing improvements to this procedure.  The RCMP staff will work with schools, law enforcement agencies, public health agencies, community library, workplaces, religious institutions, child protective agencies, volunteers, and others in the community to develop the plan.  Some suggestions are mentorship, counseling, job skill training, internships, entrepreneurship opportunities, guidance, organized recreation, tutoring programs, part-time work, and volunteer opportunities.  After the discussion with the community, the RCMP staff will come up with a goal using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely) approach and associated plan/actions.  The RCMP staff will then bring the goal and the plan to the community and get feedback.  The goal and the plan will be revised if necessary.  
Each organization and volunteer of the community executes the plan.  The RCMP staff monitors the process through a communication mechanism on a regular basis.  The RCMP staff will also adjust the plan along the process based on their feedback.  At the mid-point of the plan, the RCMP will meet all organizations and volunteers reviewing the performance of the plan.  At the end point of the plan, all objectives of the goal should be achieved.  A follow-up plan shall be taken to address the remaining issues.  
The RCMP will take a pro-active approach in developing a more creative and innovative mechanism that builds on lesson-learned and experience gained on this preventive action and other similar preventive actions to reduce teenager crimes.
