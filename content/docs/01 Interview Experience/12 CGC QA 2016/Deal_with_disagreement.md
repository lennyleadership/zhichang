It is a situational question.  Use different approaches when dealing with different personality.  

***
Scenario #1:   
**Situation and tasks**: Kent Feluschko, training, AECL  
**Actions**:  one-on-one discussion,  took initiative, 
**Results**:  problem solved, relationship built, no hidden agenda.  

***
Scenario #2:   
**Situation and tasks**: Chantelle Kryschuke, ICP results review, AECL   
**Actions**: problem not solved at the first place, leveraged co-worker's support to solve disagreement, and backed by supervisor's support.   
**Results**: report corrected.

***
Scenario #3:   
**Situation and tasks**: Section head, hiring process, AECL  
**Actions**: Expressed my opinion, but respected the decision  
**Results**: The person was hired.  The person is the best fit.  The reason was explained five years after.

***
Scenario #4:  
**Situation and tasks**: Manager, new to the safety culture, AECL
