Question 6: Why are Internal Audits conducted on the Quality Management System?  
<!--more-->

---
Response:  
The internal audits are required by section 8.2.2 of ISO 9001:2008, as well as section 4.14 of ISO 17025.  ISO 17025 states clearly that the cycle for internal auditing should normally be completed in one year.  CALA requires that internal audits be conducted on an annual basis.  All aspects of the quality management system must be audited each year; however, it is not necessary to do an internal audit of every test method every year.  
The basic premise behind ISO 9001:2008 is the “Plan, Do, Check, Act Cycle” (PDCA).  The “Check” phase is represented by the Internal Audits of the Management System.  The objective of internal audits is to document and identify:  
•	conformance of the quality system to the governing documentation (company policies, quality manual, procedures, regulations and/or standards);  
•	its effectiveness; and,  
•	how the system fosters and conducts continual improvement.  
I personally found internal audits help us to be prepared for the coming external audits.  During the recent internal audit in our facility, an internal auditor identified a couple of key areas for improvement, and followed up the corrective actions and preventive actions for the findings of the previous external audit.  After internal audit, we had enough time to address concerns/issues.
