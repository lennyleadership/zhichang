Response:  
The discontinuation can be described as suspensions and withdrawals. SCC and CALA have their own policies and procedures to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of a test laboratory.  There are similarity and slightly difference.  
For the laboratory which was accredited by SCC, the following scenarios could result in temporary or permanent non-renewal of ISO 17025 accreditation.  
•	The initial plan and implementation evidences the laboratory prepared for the recent assessment are deemed unsatisfactory, or the laboratory exceeds the timelines of submitting plan or evidences.  The laboratory may be subject to suspension.  
•	The laboratory who has failed to comply with relevant terms and conditions of accreditation, including payment of applicable fees may result in suspension and/or withdrawal of accreditation.  
•	SCC assessment teams have identified one, or a number of major non-conformities, or if a laboratory has declined a surveillance activity by SCC, or, when a laboratory brings the accreditation body into disrepute, or, when a customer has been charged with a criminal offense.  
•	The laboratory voluntarily suspense or withdraw all or part of its accreditation.  

For the laboratory which was accredited by CALA, the following scenarios could result in temporary or permanent non-renewal of ISO 17025 accreditation.  
•	if a laboratory fails to respond to requests for information related to non-conformances identified on an assessment report;  
•	upon expiration of the accreditation certificate;  
•	a laboratory fails to comply with the terms and conditions of accreditation;  
•	a laboratory fails to submit a satisfactory response or additional information required to complete a response within the timeframe pre-determined by CALA, as communicated to the laboratory; or,  
•	CALA receives substantiated information on the lack of validity of a test method.  
•	if a laboratory fails to pay all fees that are owed to CALA.  
The accreditation of a specific analysis method can be suspended or withdrawn in the following scenarios.  
•	if a laboratory fails two or three successive PT studies for a specific analyte;  
•	if a laboratory fails to submit a satisfactory PT corrective action report within the specified timeframe;  
In severe cases of non-compliance, the Accreditation Council may immediately suspend or withdraw the accreditation, in whole or in part. Such cases might involve, though may not be limited to:   
•	failure to comply with the requirements of the latest version of ISO/IEC 17025:2005; or   
•	failure to demonstrate competency in those tests for which accreditation has been granted; or  
•	misrepresentation of the laboratory’s accreditation status; or violation of the CALA Code of Ethics.  
The laboratory can voluntarily relinquish its accreditation, either in whole or in part.  
Accreditation is deemed terminated if it is either withdrawn or voluntarily relinquished.
