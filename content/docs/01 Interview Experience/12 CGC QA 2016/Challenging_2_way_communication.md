<key words> listen, understand, communicates openly with them, recognizes their contribution, and gives feedback and encouragement that enhance their job performance, do not take the issue personally.
Be assertive





Revision: 2018.10.17
Situation: Chantelle. 
She said that she knew everything about ICP-OES. When I pointed out errors on the spreadsheets or reports, She got offended.

Approach:
My approach is described the best in a quote “Better to light a candle rather than curse the darkness.”  I kept myself positively when communicating with her.  There was a time when I found out a problem on the report.  I asked her: please double-check a QC data. She got offended. I did not raise my voice.  I explained the reason. She commended that I had no idea of ICP-OES. I reported to Karen Ross.  She supported me.

Result:
She found out she was wrong.  She did not talk to me for a couple of days.  The relationship was not hurt, but she knew I did not blame her.
