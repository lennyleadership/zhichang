How to measure whether the method works?
reach the goal? if they donot reach the goal.

I have used two tools.
1) performance appraisal.  
Before monitoring performance, I set out 5 KPI for the team in one year.  They were part of performance subjective.  
During the routine operation, I monitored these 5 KPI.  Help the team when needed.  

2) Observation and coaching moments.  
stood beside the technologist observing whether they followed the procedure. Recognized them, acknowledged them, or corrected them.
