Q: What did you communicate with others when finding errors?
<!--more-->

---

My communication strategy is flexible depend upon different situations.  

1) I usually provide constructive feedback with sandwich approach. For example, when I found out error when doing lab logbook inspection at a time. I told the analyst everything looks good, here is a no-no, and here is the reason; I will not report it this time; I wish you could make correction now. So the analyst did not feel offensive, and I got the constructive feedback across.  

2) I also leverage other coworker to deliver constructive feedback.  There was a time, I pointed out the error in data, I asked the analyst reran the batch, and the report was held.  The analyst took it personal, and closed the conversation.  I had to ask the senior tech to look into this set of data, and helped me explain the reason to the analyst.  As a result, the whole batch was rerun.  

3) I sometimes gave in, and put it aside. I recalled there was a time when I reviewed raw data on the logbook. The final reporting data was not rounded.  From my perspective, we should be consistency in reporting data.  I pointed it out, the analyst argued with me and I did not argue about it.  I picked a fight.
