at AECL, chemist, quality manual revision,  
Review on the system, got support from all levels, and meet deadline.  

**Q#6: How did you organize your time?**  
response at the interview:  
i had multi-hats, in the audit year.  I did analysis, and quality management. I planned ahead of time, and broke down to a to-do list with due date of each item hon the list.  
I setup analysis and came back to office and did documents.  
When working at Testmark, I helped the team during the day, and catch up paperwork after work, and delivered coolers to the Ontario Northland bus depot at the end of the day to make sure the contract lab is able to do the tests within holding time.  
I took overtime. I communicated with my manager when there were too many items on my plate.  
to be mentioned next time: refer to the new page.  


**Q#7: What did you communicate with others when finding errors?**  
Response at the interview:  
I am a detail-oriented person, I found errors. I usually tell them upfront (straight ahead). However, it depends on personality, I asked other people to help me.  
to be mentioned next time: refer to the new page.  
小结：我是一个把记忆与影像连在一起的人。当我听到errors时，我脑海里浮现出与Chantelle为QC数据争执，而叫Randy出面的一幕。其实，还有其它场景发生，而由于我没有事先准备，我没有想起来。所以，准备是很需要的。

小结：在面试现场，我只想到 Conor Neil 在 YouTube 上的视频画面，而且记不全。另外，我只讲了两点 credibility 和 conflict management，没有举例。

**Q#10: How did you distribute workloads?**
现场我举的是写新版QA manual的例子。Hold QA officer accountable, due date, coordination with CALA.

1. Close to family;  
2. To learn MassHunter software;

Response at the interview:  
In line with four aspects: innovation, performance, collaboration, and [] (refer to four frames hanging on the wall)  

小结：现场的回答只是提到与公司文化、价值观契合。没有提及这个岗位的特性（比如动手能力，技术娴熟），以及我是否合适这个岗位。  
还有一个小窍门。雇主问的问题都是他们关心的。我就需要把几个我比较得意的，闪光的东西做个小结。  
这次我在这些方面回答得比较好：  
1) Go above and beyond my responsibilities  
2) guide young coworkers.  
3) Build trust relationship.  
4) Ensure quality while doing multitasks.  
5) Be professional when implementing unpopular policy.  
6) Commitment to customer service.  
7) strong problem-solving skills, collaborated with coworkers at different levels.
