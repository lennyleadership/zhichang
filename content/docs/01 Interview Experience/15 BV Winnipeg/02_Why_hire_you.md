I understand from the job posting, you are looking for an analyst at the senior position. During the interview, I believe that you are looking for traits / attributes such as: 1) take initiative so that the candidate should not just sit and wait direction from the manager, 2) go above and beyond the job description, 3) work ethic or commitment when clients expect results during off-hours.  I am the person who has theses attributes.  

I also think that you are looking for leadership skill that can provide coaching, or leading in different situations, with different personalities; ability that I can manage multitasks and yet assure data quality.  


You will have my commitment.
