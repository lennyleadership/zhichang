Knowledge of Principles and Practices of Quality Assurance and Quality Control in a Laboratory   

Question 5: The GRL has procedures and work instructions that explain the correct methods for carrying out various tests that are conducted in the lab.  Why is it necessary to follow these instructions?

Response:  
A quality principle is “we do what we say; and we say what we do”.  We expect to get reliable analysis results in a safe manner by everyone following standardized operating procedures.  Any deviation from the procedures could result in one of the following consequences:  
1)	It could be a safety issue.  There was an incident recently in a facility where a sample vessel used in a microwave digestion device was blown up.  The investigation found out that the analyst failed to follow the manufacturers’ recommendation for the safe, effective use of equipment that was incorporated into operating instructions/procedures.  
2)	It is a non-conformance issue from the quality management perspective.  The methods of analysis were developed based on reference methods and validated.  They were deemed ‘fit for use’ by method validation data.  Any deviations are not considered ‘fit for use’ unless further validation proves such deviations will not affect the data quality, and such deviations are examples of method ruggedness.  An oven temperature change was found in our recent external audit.  The oven temperature setting was changed and it was not corrected.  As a result, we submitted validation data to prove that the data quality was not compromised.  
3)	It could affect the instrument performance if we did not follow the manufacturers’ recommendation of maintenance.  A recent observation of elution time drift of all anions led me to realize that the analyst did not change the regeneration column on an ion chromatography instrument by following the recommendation.  
4)	It could damage the instrument.  There was a time that the small particles from aqueous sample were not filtered before introducing samples into a mercury analyzer.  They blocked a t-valve along the route and flooded the sample route and detector.   We had to change some accessories.
