# Cover Letter Thoughts

## What does a cover letter serve?

1)  a lure. From a job seeker perspective, I used it to get an interview (for screening employers).  
2)  the purpose is, from a hiring manager perspective, that I need to answer why do I hire you? / why do you think you are the best fit.  

## What should a cover letter style be?

It should be the narrative (记叙文) style. It provides context to your highlighted accomplishment/ skills/ experience.

For a job of six-figure professional, storytelling style would stand-out. It shows humility, emotional intelligence.[^cover_letter_lessons_learned-1]

[^cover_letter_lessons_learned-1]: <https://www.inc.com/jt-odonnell/in-2019-your-cover-letter-only-needs-1-thing-unfortunately-most-will-fail-to-include-it.html>

It should be like an elevator-pitch.

The effect of the cover letter should be like a first sentence before giving a presentation.

Besides the skills/competence, I should tell the employer the people side of me.

语不惊人，死不修！


## What does a cover letter contain?

## Job post

To be noticed that job post does not cover all expectations, and even may mislead job seekers. Give an example, the lab scientist job post at LifeLabs mentioned FDA regulatory requirements, but they donot have reinforcement in practice.

## Thoughts on Strategy of Preparing a Cover Letter

The goal is to get attention.

The goal is to answer the following two questions:

From employer perspective: why should I hire you?

From job seeker perspective: How so I meet their expectation?

Some suggest writing it with narrative form. Provide context.

Do analysis on job post, such as how many time a key word appear.

Like Hongwen did, read report to SEC if it is a public company.

Provide numbers, such number of staff under my leadership.

### For experienced/senior position

The employer would look for accomplishment, more than just meet job description.

Maybe qualification is not so important to be addressed on the cover letter.

### For less-experience position

The employer would look for qualification (experience, knowledge, skills, education).

Say that I enjoy the work (hint: i like the job so that it compensate the low salary).

## Cover Letter Writing: Lesson Learned

When I applied for the facility manager position at UBC, I prepared a cover letter like below:

During the past 17 years, I have developed my career in the whole scope of laboratory operation, including bench job, quality management, database management, health and safety, supervision, financial functionality, and responsibility for the total performance. Therefore my skill sets were expanded from instrumental analysis, such as headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry, gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, to advanced computer skills, interpersonal skills, people management, and performance management. The benefit of working in the research and development environment and testing service environment in the public sector and private sector would allow me to adapt to your working environment.

</br> Christine Tan revised as follows:
Throughout my career, I have been able to contribute effectively by managing the laboratory operation well which included bench job, quality & database management, supervision, financial budgets and responsibility for the overall performance. Teamwork and collaboration have been key components in my previous role which gave me the opportunity to work with different departments.
Beyond just the skills of instrumental analysis, I believe that my computer skills, interpersonal skills and performance management ability plus my qualifications are an ideal match to the Facility Manager requirements mentioned. My experience of having worked both in the public and private sector would add to my contribution in this role with the University of British Columbia.

</br> My second version is as follows:
The responsibilities of this job reminded me of my voluntary at a summer campground, where I served others. I also connect it to my sport hobby - rowing because teamwork is the key for success.
Throughout my career, I have been able to contribute and make improvement in every aspect of laboratory operation which includes bench job, quality and database management, health and safety, supervision, financial functionality, and responsibility for the overall performance.
Besides my competence in instrumental analysis, research and development, and value-added skills in advanced computer programming, my interpersonal skills working with different personality in the public and private sector would enable me to maintain positive relationships at LFS Analytical Core Laboratory. My supervisors, coworkers, and neighbors commented that I am committed to the team success, trustworthy, a man of integrity, and a friendly and pleasant person to work with.

</br> The learning is this:
1) Use 'I contributed before' rather than 'I developed (skills) before'. The difference is: The first statement is customer-oriented, the second statement is self-oriented. There is no connection between my skill-sets and what the employer looks for. 'Self-oriented' does not mean not to use "I", but use 'customer-oriented' verb. 'Self-oriented' presents glowing/shining experience, but as Jan Palaty said that the employer cares only about THEIR needs, they don't care about YOU, and that the key to an effective letter is to address THEIR needs first, rather than providing a glowing description of yourself. If the relationship was not built well, I would not have chance to make improvement.

I think I practiced inconsistently before, sometimes I did so without knowing the guide, sometimes I made mistake.

2)  It is okay to talk about 'people skills', or 'soft skills' for the supervisory position, because technique skills are not much important for this type of position. If the position is technical position, it is okay to talk about tech only.

3)  The cover letter serves as a first layer, it makes reader be interested in reading the resume. Use general terms found in the job posts,

4)  It is also a good practice to add one line at the end of the cover letter when I feel I am not quite qualified, or when I send a cold email.

</br> 后现代的人不会去做three-way communication，尝试去了解对方想说什么。找工作也是如此，雇主不会去看你有多能耐，如果不会变现，等于零。

To set yourself apart from other applicants, you'll need to show your cover letter writing chops. That's why we've put together this list of tips for writing your advertising cover letter. Use these along with LiveCareer's Cover Letter Builder to create a cover letter that will make advertising professional want to meet with you, and give you the best chance of competing for--and winning--your dream ad job.

CREATE MY COVER LETTER

* You want the cover letter to draw attention to you and get the hiring manager to take your resume seriously. Make the content unique, i.e., do not reiterate (重复) what's in the resume. Use it to promote yourself, your specific advertising skills and `r em("why that should be important to the company", "brown")`.^[Mark Yip came from this perspective, perhaps.]  

* Avoid being `r em("too wordy", "brown")`. The resume will detail your experiences, but your advertising cover letter should be short and sweet as possible. Get to the point because hiring managers are busy people and `r em("don't have time for elegant prose", "brown")`.  

* Try to demonstrate that you not only know advertising, you know the agency in question and their brand. Let the hiring manager know why you'd like to work there `r em("both personally and professionally", "brown")`.  

* Summarize your experiences succinctly (简明扼要) in ways that relate to the position you're applying to. Let the hiring manager see you're the perfect fit through `r em("what you've done, what you're doing and what you can bring to the table", "brown")`.  

* If there are any major projects or key clients you've associated with, feel free to mention them without getting into specifics. (Leave that for the resume.) `r em("Relevant", "brown")` experience is vital in advertising.  

* We cannot stress this point enough: `r em("avoid hyperbole ", "brown")`(不要空洞, 不要讲大话). Don't say you're a team player. Show it. Anyone can say it (and as hiring managers know, many do).  

* I look forward to hearing from you. and I hope to hear from you soon. are clichés. Advertising is all about calls to action. Use one when you close out the advertising cover letter. I appreciate your time and I'm excited about this opportunity. Let's set up an appointment and talk at your convenience.

* Remember, the resume has to be constructed of facts. The cover letter can be `r em("personal", "brown")`. Use it to illuminate your `r em("personality", "brown")`. Fill it with positive energy and enthusiasm and set yourself apart from the mass of static and boring cover letters out there.

# Write a Cover Letter as an Advertisement ^[https://zh.wikihow.com/写好广告文案]

## 掌握基础知识 Mastering the Basics

* 先决定要在哪里打广告。你的广告是要放在报纸上、杂志上、你的网站上，还是人人网上？广告的刊登位置将会影响编写广告的方式。计算刊登广告的空间，包括广告的要求字数，字体有多大，还有你能否添加插图或视频。最后，传统的分类形式的广告几乎可以在任何媒体形式中使用，但是你可能需要做一些微调，以适应空间的限制。  
如果你要在本地报纸上打一条占四分之一到全页的广告，你就可以把广告语分成一段或几段。 
然而，在人人上或其他网页上打广告，你的广告语就要限制在一句话左右。  
无论是哪种方式，当你在编写广告时，每个词都很重要。广告太含糊或是太长就会让人想一扫而过，不会停下来好好阅读，因此，无论写哪种广告，原则都是相同的。  

* 要让广告迎合观众的口味。你要面对什么样的消费者？如果每个阅读你广告的人都会想买你的商品，当然是最理想的情况，但实际上，如果你的广告专门去迎合一部分更有购买可能的人，结果会更好。用语言和文字去吸引那些被你的商品所吸引的人。虽然这样可能完全不对另一部分人的胃口，但是把宣传深入到可能成为你的忠实顾客的人心中去，是很重要的。 
例如，如果你想推销一项出版自己的书的服务，你可以用文艺的、高雅的语言。这样一来，你的宣传目标人群（想出版自己作品的人）就会知道你们公司将会成为他的得力助手。 
如果你正在推销一种吸引年轻人群的产品，比如一种让你的舌头变成彩虹颜色的新型糖果，那就放下传统礼节，去使用目标人群熟悉的语言吧。你的目标人群就是那些想用零花钱买糖的孩子，或那些为孩子买糖的家长。 

* 写一个引人注意的标题。这是广告中最重要的部分，因为这是广告观众最先注意到的。如果你的标题含糊不清、晦涩难懂或是无聊乏味，就别指望别人会花时间读你下功夫写的广告正文了。你这是在告诉读者，你们公司没有能力写出新颖的广告——这也会让读者感觉你们的产品质量很差，即使产品实际上很好也没用。
人们乘坐地铁、刷人人或翻杂志时，注意力会被很多东西分散到你的广告之外。如何才能让读者不被干扰，只注意到你的产品呢？想一个极其有吸引力的、以至于迫使读者注意的标题吧。  
你的标题可以是一些令人震惊的、奇怪的、引人注意的，或是激动人心的内容——什么都可以，只要它能吸引读者。  
写一些故弄玄虚的内容：“不要高兴，这是很恐怖的事情”。  
写一些人们不愿错过的内容：“2.5折的巴黎机票”。  
写一些能打动人的内容：“她只能活两周了”。  

* 别用问题开头。虽然一个有创意的、吸引人的反问句可能会成功吸引观众，但是不要用那种类似“你需要一辆新车吗？”这样的标准问题来作为广告的开头。顾客已经阅读过上千个这样的广告了，他们也已经被问烦了。你要向更深入的方向挖掘，以抓住读者的注意力。别再问那么肤浅的问题了，用一个有创意的方式来告诉顾客你有他们需要的商品吧。  

* 写一段过度性的话，来吸引读者继续阅读。标题下的一行是你在观众脑海中为自己公司营造深刻印象的好机会。在写了神秘的、令人震惊的、富有感染力的标题后，你需要写一些实质性的东西——不然，你的标题就会被认为只是在吹牛而已。[1] 要用过渡性的话来告诉观众，你的产品是有实力的，并非徒有虚名。  
要牢记，每个词都很重要。你的过渡性语句也要跟标题一样吸引人，因为在广告结束之前，你随时都有可能失去观众。  
在广告中提及产品的主要优点将会吸引消费者。你的文段中必须提及产品的最大卖点。  
小提示：要记住，每个字都很重要。你的过渡性言语必须和标题一样引人注目，因为他们仍然很可能会不等广告结束就消失无踪。  

* 勾起观众对你产品的购买欲。你的过渡性语言也是产品强有力的宣传机会。这是你“操纵”观众心理，让他们认为你的产品就是他们想要的东西的好机会。这样做听起来好像是在操控别人？其实就是这样的。但是如果你的产品对顾客来说的确有效，那触动顾客心弦，让他们买可以提高生活质量的产品，就不是什么让人羞耻的事情了。  
怀旧是抓住人心的好方法。例如，“我们用最好的祖传辣椒，做出和爷爷秘制辣酱一样好的酱。”  
在广告中涉及人们的健康问题也会有很好的效果：“你工作努力过头了——辞职吧。让我们帮你重新学会享受生活。”  
别忘了在广告中加上你公司和你的产品的名字。  

* 告诉大家如何购买你的产品。最后，告诉消费者下一步该怎么做，用它来为广告添上点睛之笔。给他们一些指导，让他们能更方便地购买你的产品或联系你。
你还可以只列出你的网页，人们就会知道应该在哪购买你的产品。  


## 修改你的广告 Refining Your Ad

* 仔细分析烂广告。如果你是写广告的新手，你需要分析其他的广告，并且总结它们哪里有问题。找几条烂广告（看一眼你就知道哪些是烂广告了），然后试着总结是什么原因导致它们那样没有感染力。是标题？过度部分？还是语调？  
一旦你精确定位出广告哪里不好，就想想你怎样可以把它写得更好。重新写广告，使它变得更有效。  
也要看看有效的广告，然后尽力判断是什么使它们如此精彩。  

* 让广告听起来自然一些。当你创作自己的广告时   ，尽量让它听起来越自然越好。编写广告时的语气就像跟人说话一样。人们会被自然的语气吸引——生硬的写作是不会吸引人的，它会让人觉得拘谨。  
语气别太僵硬，得让你的观众接受并理解你。 
也别太友善，那样听起来会很假。  

* 把广告写得短一些。无论你要在哪里打广告，你都应该把它写得简洁明了。人们不会花30秒以上去读一则广告，甚至连30秒以下的时间都不愿意耗费。他们在做别的事时看到了你的广告，比如说骑自行车的路上，或者是下火车、下公交车时。你的广告要能用很少的语言，给他们留下深刻的印象。  
别用长句子，尽量使用短句。稍长一些的句子很难在短时间内被理解。  
玩一些文字游戏，以便更好地表达你的意思。把意思表达清楚就好，你不需要全都用完整的句子。  
小提示：由于你的广告需要非常短，所以就一定要表述准确。不要用模糊的语言，要直接说到点子上。  


* 考虑在广告中加入客户的评价。最近一段时间，人们在购买产品之前喜欢先浏览产品的评论和其他客户的评价。在确定产品对其他人有效之前，他们是不会心满意足的。在广告中加入一到两条客户评价，会立刻取得客户的信任。  
如果可能的话，选择一条来自有声望的客户的评论。例如，如果你在销售保健品，用一个医生或者健康专家的评论。  
如果你的空间有限，不一定要把客户评价放在广告中，你的网站中总是搁得下客户评价的吧。  

* 聪明地使用图表。如果你有机会在广告中使用图片或者录像，一定要仔细构思广告的布局。有一个图像可以让你节省许多文字。你没必要非得在广告中描述产品的特点，或是说明它是什么东西，相反地，在标题或者产品口号还有你们公司的网址旁边，放一张图片或一段视频就好。  
选择图片和视频跟编写广告同样重要——甚至更重要。选择能打动顾客并激起他们购买欲望的图表。  

* 把你的广告念出来，然后录下来。广告写完后，把它录下来或念给别人听。然后再放给自己听。这个广告听起来像是一段对话吗？听起来吸引人吗？如果别人这么跟你说，你会感兴趣吗？大声地把广告念出来是发现致命缺点的好方法。  

* 检验你的广告。在一些地方打广告，并且看看大家的反应。说不定你可以看到产品的销量开始增加。通过询问顾客他们是怎么了解到你们公司的，你就可以知道新的销量是否是广告的直接影响力。如果他们引用了你的广告，那你就知道自己成功啦！  


* 重新写广告，直到成功为止。如果广告没有帮助产品的销量增加，就别再用它了。重新编写广告，直到你相信它一定会吸引更多的客户。一则不能展示公司优点的烂广告弊大于利。当你的广告已经使用了一段时间后，为了增添一些新的活力，也要重新编写，加入一些新的产品或产品新的性能。

# Tailoring Accomplishments to Your Cover Letter


By LiveCareer Staff Writer

Cover letters afford job-seekers greater opportunities than do resumes to describe accomplishments in detail and with more context. Cover letters offer job-seekers relatively wide latitude to tell stories about accomplishments and successes because letters are quite compatible with the narrative form. In a cover letter, you can engage the employer, make an emotional connection, show results, and become instantly memorable by including at least one paragraph in the form of a powerful accomplishment.  

Hiring decision-makers vary in the importance they place on cover letters. Not all employers read cover letters (about a third don't), but those who read, do truly read the letter, unlike the resume, which they almost always skim. Cover letters, effectively crafted, frequently distinguish the candidate. Of the employers who favored cover letters in the white paper I wrote, Cover Letter Reboot: [A Crowdsourced Update of Traditional Cover-letter Advice for Today's Job Search](https://www.livecareer.com/wp-content/qc/CoverLetterWhitePaper.pdf), many wanted to see accomplishments included, particularly accomplishments targeted specifically to the hiring organization's needs. Fred R. Cooper, managing partner, Compass HR Consulting, LLC, for example, wants to see "**what have you accomplished that is `r em("relevant", "blue")` to my needs and my company**.  

Here's what others said:

> _"I want to see the 3-4 juicy accomplishments from a candidate's career (that match my advertised need). These highlights must excite me to such a level that this candidate becomes a can't-miss prospect. If I am not swept away by the cover letter, then reading the resume is often anti-climactic and doomed for failure."_  
> -- Ron Kubitz, recruiting manager, Brayman Construction Corp., Saxonburg, PA

> "I like a bullet list of key accomplishments that can be backed up with quantitative data -- real numbers -- that prove to me you have a 'proven track record.' ... I also look for how well the candidate understands what I need in the way of a solutions-provider and problem-solver."
> -- J.T. Kirk, J.T. Kirk Industries, author of Confessions of a Hiring Manager Rev. 2.0: Getting to and Staying at the Top of the Hiring Manager's Short List in a Confused Economy(2011)

Let's look at some ways paragraphs about accomplishments can fit into a typical cover-letter structure.  

The first paragraph should spark the employer's interest, provide information about the benefits the employer will receive from you, and help you stand out from all the other job-seekers who want the job. Focus on your **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)** -- the one thing that makes you different from all the other job-seekers - and identifying benefits you can offer the employer.  

**Accomplishments-driven first paragraphs**. Note that in both the following examples, the job-seeker provides a summary of ongoing accomplishments, laying the groundwork for specifics later on:

> I have increased the size and sales levels of my client base in every position I have held, which in turn has increased the revenues and profits of my employers. I want to bring this same success to the account position you have posted on your Website.

> As HR director for the Kearney Public School District, I restored the administration's faith in contracting with temporary agencies and workers, contributed my professionalism during a staffing crisis, and provided valuable insight to help the district recruit and retain productive, happy employees. I am convinced I can bring the same leadership to your school district.


The second paragraph should provide more detail about your professional and/or academic qualifications. Expand on specific items from your resume that are relevant to the qualifications sought in the job you seek. Or, if responding to a job posting or job ad, tailor this paragraph to the qualifications and employer needs described in the posting.
These qualifications might include skills, values, or experience.  

**Accomplishments-driven second paragraph that spotlights a skill (strategic ability)**:

> As director of the Tokyo Tourism Board, I have demonstrated my strategic abilities by developing programs that resulted in an 18 percent increase in traffic to Tokyo in 2007, traffic growth of more than 10 percent in 2006, total spending and per-capita spending growth of 15 percent and 5 percent respectively, as well as 5 percent growth in length-of-stay to 3.66 nights.

**Accomplishments-driven second paragraph that spotlights a value (motivation)**:

> My high degree of motivation has been recognized by my previous employers who have quickly promoted me to positions of greater responsibility. I was promoted from assistant editor to editor of Alexandria Monthly after only five months.

**Accomplishments-driven second paragraph that spotlights experience (in marketing)**:

>My marketing experience is extensive and diverse -- from opening up new markets to tapping into my vast pool of contacts in both business and government. During my marketing career with Pepsico, I influenced the objectives and direction of franchised bottler management, engendering significant credibility, mutual trust, and respect, and facilitating solid growth when the rest of the country was experiencing decline during the toughest year.

The third paragraph should relate your accomplishments to the company, giving details why you should be considered for the position. Expand on your qualifications while showing knowledge of the company.  

**Accomplishments-driven third paragraph that `r em("connects", "red")` accomplishments to the employer's requirements**:

> I have built on my distinctive background in information technology leadership by developing exceptional expertise in managing large-scale technology projects, consistently delivering results within time and budget constraints, and developing teams to produce innovative solutions in bureaucratic environments. For example, I successfully executed CIO operations of a 2,000-person, $600 million Superfund Toxic-Dump Cleanup Project. The parallels between your requirements and my ongoing contributions for municipalities in Maryland are remarkable.

**Accomplishments-driven third paragraph that `r em("connects", "red")` accomplishments with knowledge of the employer**:

> I'm no stranger to John Hancock, having conducted a cultural profile on financial services companies nationwide, thus providing consumer bank leaders with feedback and data to help them to clarify the direction for strategic planning. This work was so successful that our consulting practice, Colorado River Consulting, was entrusted to participate in a worldwide change effort.

**Accomplishments-driven third paragraph that `r em("connects", "red")` accomplishments with a specific employer need**:

> You seek someone who can bring greater systems stability to your operation. One of my most rewarding accomplishments was stabilizing a Fortune 500 company's infrastructure by examining areas where the outages were occurring. I generated buy-in to implement a preventive-maintenance schedule that proactively rebooted systems during scheduled downtimes. I then oversaw database cleanup during scheduled outages to reduce unplanned outages. My plan reduced the number of high severity incidents from multiple instances a week to less than one per quarter.

The fourth paragraph of your cover letter requests action -- a job interview or meeting. It's unusual, though not unheard of, to include accomplishments in this paragraph:

>Because my solid record of 26 patents and 60 publications provides strong evidence that I am a productive scientist, I know I can produce results for your organization. That's why I'd like to request that we meet at your earliest convenience.

## Tips for Presenting Accomplishments in Your Cover Letter {-}
**Consider bullets**, writes Deborah Brown-Volkman, president of Surpass Your Dreams, Inc. a career, life, and mentor coaching company. "Bullets work well in making your accomplishments easy to read." Brown-Volkman suggests leading into this bulleted accomplishments list with a phrase along these lines: "Here are relevant examples of what I have done that match with what you are looking for ..." Caution: When you bullet accomplishments in your cover letter, you may come perilously close to rehashing your resume. Rephrase them and provide additional details to avoid redundancy  

**Frame your accomplishments with the journalism questions -- who, what, when, where, why and how**, advise the folks at OptimalResume.com -- and do it succinctly.  

**Use a two-column format**. A particularly effective way to showcase accomplishments is to show how they qualify you to meet an employer's requirements using a two-column format (also known as a "T-formation" letter) in which you quote in the left-hand column specific qualifications that come right from the employer's job posting and in the right-hand column, your attributes that meet those qualifications. The two-column format is extremely effective when you possess all the qualifications for a job, but it can even sell you when you lack one or more qualifications. The format so clearly demonstrates that you are qualified in so many areas that the employer may be willing to overlook the areas in which your exact qualifications are deficient.  

One of my former students describes her success in using the two-column format: "Several months ago, you referred me to your Website where there was a sample of a cover letter using a **'you require/I offer' table format**. Believe it or not, I sent in my resume along with a cover letter in this format to a job that was posted on Monster.com, and I actually got an interview!! The position is with [name of company], and I can't even imagine how many applicants they had. When I went in for the interview, the person that I met with complimented me on the cover letter and actually said that that's what got me in the door ahead of so many others! I used one of my own letters as a sample of an [accomplishments-based two-column letter](https://www.livecareer.com/wp-content/qc/accomplishments-2-column-cover-letter.pdf).  

**Consider opening your cover letter with an accomplishment**. As we saw in the preceding section describing the parts of a cover letter, opening your letter with an accomplishment is a terrific attention-getter. Typically, an opener contains a summary of accomplishments, which may be detailed further in the body of the letter. A couple more samples of openers:  

> I have increased the size and sales levels of my client base in every position I have held, which in turn has increased the revenues and profits of my employers. I want to bring this same success to the account position you have posted on your Website.

Here's one from resume writer Ross Macpherson:  

> Over the past 12 years, I've won 38 national sales performance awards including Salesperson of the Year (6x) and President's Circle (15x).

**Try a cover letter that opens with an accomplishment summary**, supported by bullets describing specific accomplishments. This variation on the accomplishments opener immediately leads into specifics in the form of bullet points, as in this sample:

> My solid sales background, experience in Department of Defense and other federal sales, as well as my success with management and client service, make me an ideal candidate for the VP of sales position that you are currently advertising. Throughout my extensive career, I have proven my motivation, sales expertise, management, and operational skills. For example, during my time as Director, Army Major Programs, and Director, DoD Sales, at FuturaFind, I have:  
* Increased unit sales from $4 million annually to more than $30 million yearly.  
* Boosted backlog from $3 million in 2008 to $40+ million in 2012.  
* Overseen achievement of more than 50 percent of total company revenue out of three company business units.  
* Led growth of the Army team from $50K in backlog to $31+ million in backlog in three years, and recently closed a $15 million contract negotiation that accounted for 45 percent of total company orders in 2012.   

**Consider the "Get attention -> Stimulate desire -> Reinforce with reasons" format**. Storytelling guru Steve Denning suggests a formula that can be applied to cover letters.  

**Get attention** by describing a problem the prospective employer has or a need the organization desires to fill. It must be a problem or need the employer has acknowledged -- say, in a job posting or in a networking conversation.  

**Stimulate desire** by telling how you can solve the problem or meet the need for the employer.  

**Reinforce with reasons** by describing an accomplishment in which you solved a similar problem or met a similar need for a past employer. This technique works because employers know that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance.  

The format can use accomplishments for each of these three elements; in [this sample](https://www.livecareer.com/wp-content/qc/GetAttentionCoverLetter.pdf), accomplishments are featured in the "desire" and "reasons" portions."

# Cover Letter only needs one thing

`r em("", "red")`

`r em("", "blue")`

`r em("", "brown")`


In 2019, [Your Cover Letter Only Needs 1 Thing](https://www.inc.com/jt-odonnell/in-2019-your-cover-letter-only-needs-1-thing-unfortunately-most-will-fail-to-include-it.html) (Unfortunately, Most Will Fail to Include It) If you don't have this in your cover letter, it won't get read. Here's why.  
BY J.T. O'DONNELL, FOUNDER AND CEO, WORKITDAILY.COM, `@JTODONNELL`  

Anyone who claims cover letters are a waste of time has never used a `r em("disruptive", "red")` cover letter before. It's true, old-school résumés that wax on about how great you are don't work. It only takes recruiters a few seconds of reading one of those to realize you're using the outdated format to oversell yourself -- and that's when they toss it. In the words of Ariana Grande, "Thank you. Next."  

However, when you approach the cover letter with some `r em("original", "blue")` thought, you have an incredible opportunity to stand out and get the attention (and respect!) you're looking for from potential employers.  

**All Good Marketing Gets You at "Hello"**  
If you think of job seekers as businesses-of-one selling their services to employers, then the résumé is the `r em("specs sheet", "blue")`. It outlines the features and benefits the job seeker can provide to the employer. Which means the cover letter should serve a different purpose. The mistake most people make with cover letters is `r em("too much self-promotion", "red")`. Telling an employer how great you are makes you sound like a snake-oil salesman. It not only raises doubt, but it can also make you appear desperate. If you're as good as you think you are, you shouldn't have to `r em("hype", "blue")` yourself in a cover letter. Instead, the content of the cover letter should `r em("focus on the employer", "blue")`^[Jan Palaty is correct. Kevin Yip: do not oversell yourself]. Let's face it, that's what they really want to talk about -- themselves and their needs. Or, more important, how you identify with their vision and purpose.  

**Remember Show and Tell in School? It's the Same Concept**  
A `r em("disruptive", "red")` cover letter will get the employer's attention, because you show them how`r em("deeply", "blue")`  you understand them. To be part of their tribe, you have to share `r em("one or more", "blue")` experiences you've had that taught you that what they for do for work is smart, valuable, and worth building a business around. Hiring managers want to know you have what's called "`r em("intrinsic motivation", "blue")`" to do their work. This is when you're driven by your own values and beliefs to do a good job. The best way to prove this to an employer within a cover letter is `r em("via storytelling", "blue")`^[Kevin Yip: be personalized.  It means do not be like a cookie cutter]. `r em("Share a time", "blue")` when you realized your connection to their mission and the work you'd be doing. That's the secret to a killer cover letter in 2019. Is it more work? Yes. But the potential to land your dream job is worth it.  

**For Example ...**  
I recently had a client identify a company on his interview bucket list that he greatly admired, but the company had no open positions posted online in his area of expertise. I had him craft a `r em("disruptive", "red")` cover letter sharing a story from his time on the job at another company that taught him how valuable the work the company he admired was doing in the marketplace. He sent the letter to the CEO and got a call within one week asking him to come in for coffee. The CEO told him straight out, "I don't have a job for you, but I've been thinking about creating a new position, and I need someone with your skills who understands our mission. Your cover letter really blew me away. It was like you were reading my mind. I'd like to find a way to work together. But, if I can't, a friend of mine owns a company that is hiring for your skill set and I'd be happy to introduce you." He's now working for this CEO and has essentially crafted his dream job there. This can happen to you, too, but only if you make the effort to customize your cover letters to connect more deeply with your dream employers.

**P.S.: Executives Are the Worst Offenders**  
Of all the professionals I've coached on cover letters, the worst offenders when it comes to a bragging cover letter are executives. For some reason, they've adopted the outdated mindset that they need to write in fancy language just how amazing they are. Unfortunately, they forget that the first person who is reading and evaluating the cover letter is a recruiter who is likely unimpressed and cynical by nature. Nothing screams narcissistic, stuffy, and desperate more than one of these cover letters. So, if you're a `r em("six-figure", "blue")` professional, the disruptive cover letter becomes even more important in that you have an opportunity to show your `r em("humility", "blue")` and `r em("emotional intelligence", "blue")` at a time when companies are looking for more of this from their executive teams.

# The Key to Landing Your Next Job? Storytelling.

`r em("", "red")`

`r em("", "blue")`

`r em("", "brown")`

Four tips that will help you get noticed (and get ahead) in your career. by Janine Kurnoff and Lee Lazarus  
May 13, 2021  


Summary.  
Recruiters may think they make decisions based purely on logic, but their feelings play just as large of a role. Emotions drive how connected we feel to other people, and those connections lead us to perceive someone in either a positive or a negative light. The quickest way to land on the “positive” side of that equation is simple: Tell a good story on your resume, in your cover letter, and during your interview.

* Begin with your audience in mind. What is their role? What is their level? What’s going on with their business and their industry? What current challenges are most important to them?  
* Now, craft a narrative — both through the accomplishments you include on your resume and through the message you write in your cover letter.  
* Provide context to establish how what you bring to the table as a candidate is perfect for the challenges and needs their company is looking to hire for.   


Today’s workforce is hyper-competitive. It’s hard to stand out, and if you’re hunting for a job, you need strategies to appear more credible, authentic, and memorable than your peers.  

What’s the best approach?  

In his bestselling book, Brain Rules, molecular biologist John Medina shares a surprising insight that explains why one job candidate’s application gets them noticed while another’s lands them in the reject pile: `r em("emotion", "blue")`.  

Recruiters may think they make decisions based purely on logic, but `r em("their feelings play just as large of a role", "blue")`. It’s human nature. Emotions drive how connected we feel to other people, and those connections lead us to perceive someone in either a positive or a negative light. The quickest way to land on the “positive” side of that equation is simple: Tell a good story on your resume, in your cover letter, and during your interview.

> With the right narrative, you can make anyone you want feel great — about you.

Storytelling is a powerful tool when it comes to influence and persuasion. Science tells us that voicing our opinions is often more polarizing than persuasive, and statistics, even when used as evidence, are difficult to retain. But if you blend the two together and weave them into an engaging narrative, suddenly, you can tug at heart strings and change minds.

This means you, job candidate, have a lot of power. With the right narrative, you can make anyone you want feel great — about you. All you have to do is organize your ideas into a story that elicits positive emotions, resulting in a rush of the feel-good hormone, dopamine, in your listener’s brain. As Medina points out, “Dopamine greatly aids memory and information processing … it creates a Post-It note that reads, ‘Remember this.’”

So how can you weave storytelling into your next job application? Here are four tips that will help you get noticed — and get ahead — in your career.

**Begin with your audience in mind**.  
Increasingly, employers are using artificial intelligence platforms to quickly scan through thousands of resumes and make decisions based solely on objective criteria (like keywords that match job descriptions). These are important factors to incorporate into your resume, which should be tailored to the specific job you’re applying to. But the good news is that appealing to a robot recruiter is not incompatible with appealing to a human recruiter behind the screen. You can, and should, try to influence both.

Whether you’re fresh out of college, or a seasoned industry vet, many of us enter the job-hunting process thinking it’s best to offer a lengthy, chronological laundry list of projects and activities we’ve been part of. Why not? If you jam in as much experience as you can fit into a 45-minute interview or a two-paragraph email, something’s gotta click, right?

Actually, the opposite is true.

Let’s stop and look at this through a business storytelling lens. Is the person receiving this information going to remember everything? No way. Would it be wiser to use your time prioritizing the information that will be most relevant to them? Absolutely.

> You don’t want to seem like a cookie cutter applicant. You want to seem like a real human.

We can’t say it enough: Always begin with your audience in mind. What is their role? What is their level? What’s going on with their business and industry? What current challenges are most important to them?

Conducting some extra research on LinkedIn, the company website, a corporate report, or through mutual contacts will let you “walk in the recruiter’s shoes” and craft a narrative — both through the accomplishments you include on your resume and through the message you write in your cover letter — of how what you bring to the table as a candidate is perfect for the challenges and needs their company is looking to hire for.

And remember, recruiters are looking for more than a list of skills and experiences. They want to hire a candidate who possesses both the technical skills the position requires and soft skills — also known as people skills: authenticity, strong communication, mindfulness, inclusivity, and the ability to bring new perspectives to a team. Resist the temptation to pepper your resume and cover letters with jargony keywords, and instead, be thoughtful about the words you use to convey your voice and tone. You don’t want to seem like a cookie cutter applicant. You want to seem like a real human.

**Have a theme — and promote it throughout your job hunt.**  
Now that you know your audience, stop and imagine the ONE thing you want your prospective boss to remember about you above everything else. Before you interact with a recruiter, hiring manager, or anyone, be prepared to offer a single, simple theme you will leave with them.

In storytelling, this is called the big idea and it’s the lynchpin of every good narrative. During your job hunt, your theme, or big idea, should encapsulate precisely what you will bring to an organization and be woven into all of your written and verbal communications.

Are you trying to join a marketing organization? The overarching theme in your application materials could relay: I’m a person who is driven by innovation and growth. Every example you cite should point to how you use your creativity to help brands expand their audience. (I grew a marketing department by 50%. I increased clicks on our ads by 30%. Our customer base doubled in two years.)

If you are a recent grad just beginning your search, you may be wondering how you can have a “theme” as someone with a limited employment history. Well, you may not have a lot of job experience, but you do have more than 20 years of life experience, moving through the world with your unique history, mind, and perspective. This alone provides you with a great foundation for telling the story of who you are, what you’ve done, the challenges you’ve overcome, and the type of employee you’ll be if hired.

> Your theme is not just there to help you take control of your narrative — it is a tool you can use to influence the memory a recruiter associates with you.

For instance, let’s say you want to join that marketing organization, but you’re also fresh out of college. To start, showcase your theme by saying something like, “I’m all about boosting brand awareness on social media.” From there, cite specific examples from your personal social media accounts, one-off gigs, internships, or school projects. Maybe you can describe how you grew your TikTok following by 50% in a year and how you’re excited to help XYZ company do the same. Or maybe you can share how, in your last internship, you helped the marketing team grow their newsletter subscribers by 25% in just three months.

Again, all the experiences you reference on your resume, in your cover letter, and during your interview should directly tie into this single idea. Your theme is not just there to help you take control of your narrative — it is a tool you can use to influence the memory a recruiter associates with you.

Throughout the application process, you’ll have to tell many stories about yourself and your experiences. Like all great stories, the experiences you talk about will need clear context to resonate with your listeners. Storytelling experts call context the “why” that drives the plot of a narrative. It gives your audience a reason to listen through to the end and arrive happily at your resolution.

Job hunters often make the mistake of leading with their resolution. (I managed a team during my summer job. I built a 50K digital marketing campaign. I implemented a plan to reduce the cost of our supply chain by 25%.) These are all good things to include on your resume, which will likely be quickly skimmed and used to judge your capabilities.

In your cover letter and in your interview, however, it’s your chance to really expand, let your personality shine, and set yourself apart from all the other candidates. You do this through context.

Whether you’re just starting out or have years of experience, context is typically established through three things: setting, characters, and conflict. Let’s break these elements down:

Setting: The place where the event of your story occurs. Did you launch a product in a past job? Your setting could be the marketplace for this product.

Characters: The people involved in and impacted by the inciting incident of your story. Were you leading a team on campus, or managing an important project at work? Were you working with suppliers, volunteers, or interns? Paint the characters in your story to make it (and you) feel more authentic.

Conflict: The inciting incident that causes you and the other characters in your story to take action. What problem were you trying to solve together? It could be your sales plummeting or even something as simple as a disorganized process that needed to be optimized. Spelling out the conflict is crucial because it builds tension and raises the stakes. Think of it like this: What makes the hero of a story heroic? Saving the day — or resolving some kind of conflict.

As you tell your story, let the context sink in to give your potential boss or co-worker a reason to lean in and gain a better understanding of how you work with others, approach challenging situations, and solve problems. This is the best way to establish your credibility.

Be the hero. End your story with a clearly stated resolution.
With all of this context, you’ve hopefully given your prospective colleague or manager a reason to care about the outcome of your story. And, if you’ve researched your audience well, you’re highlighting experiences that will feel relevant to their world.

Now it’s time to be the hero and tell them how you resolved the conflict you set up. This is the part of the story where you can state those impressive metrics listed on your resume, but in a lot more detail.

For instance, your resume might say, “Boosted sales by 15% in the first quarter of the fiscal year.”

> In the end, the resolution you are suggesting is to hire you.

In your cover letter, and during your interview, you can expand this resolution into a much more interesting narrative: “One of my strengths is the ability to pivot strategically under pressure (the big idea). For example, our sales plummeted in the last quarter of this fiscal year due to travel bans brought on by Covid-19 (the conflict). To work around this, I started thinking about what our customers (the characters) really needed from us during this time, and how we could refocus our strategy to serve domestic markets (the setting) with locally produced products. My team (more characters) did this by doing A, B, and C. As a result, we were not only able to contribute to improving local economies worldwide, we also boosted our sales by 15% the first quarter of the next year (the resolution).”

Do you see the difference? One version states a fact, whereas the other breaks down how you solve problems and what you value as an individual: contributing to local communities and bettering the lives of your customers during a challenging time.

You get the idea.

In the end, the resolution you are suggesting is to hire you. Combined, the above tools can help you influence any recruiter to do just that.

Storytelling is innate in all of us.
If you’re feeling intimidated, remember that you are already a master storyteller. Every time a family member asks you how you are and you respond genuinely, you are telling a story. Every time you recall a funny memory during a conversation with your friends, you are telling a story. Every time you “catch up” with your coworkers, you are probably also telling some kind of story — about your life, about your mental health, or even about your weekend plans.

Now apply your special skill to your job applications, and see what happens. We promise, it will be good.

You’ve got this.

# 8 Powerful Ways to Start a Cover Letter (With Examples)

By Indeed Editorial Team
August 25, 2020


A cover letter is the perfect way to get the hiring manager's attention and detail your accomplishments. To immediately get the employer's attention, you need a powerful introduction that sets you apart from the competition. Learning how to start your cover letter ensures you set a positive tone for the rest of your application. In this article, we offer some ways to start your cover letter and provide examples.

[8 ways to start your cover letter](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-to-start-a-cover-letter)  

Here's how you can start a cover letter in eight different ways:

* Show your enthusiasm
* Highlight a mutual connection
* Lead with an impressive accomplishment
* Explain what you like about the company
* Express passion for what you do
* Tell a creative story
* Include a belief statement
* Describe what you can do for the business

1. Show your enthusiasm  
Being enthusiastic is often a good predictor of a strong work ethic. It also shows that you're motivated to get the role. Start your cover letter with one or two reasons that make you excited about the open role, like the company culture, certain events it produces or duties you would be responsible for.

Example: “I was excited to see that Yukon Industries is hiring an event manager who is skilled at increasing brand awareness and driving growth with high-traffic events, especially since I've attended several of your company's speaking events myself. With my five years of experience coordinating events in the corporate world, I confident that I'm a great fit for the role.”

2. Highlight a mutual connection  
If a former colleague referred you to the job, the beginning of your cover letter can be a place to mention that connection. It grabs the hiring manager's attention because they'll want to see why someone they know recommended you for the role. If the hiring manager respects and values the opinions of the colleague you mention, you have a higher chance of getting to the next step in the hiring process. Mentioning a mutual connection also serves as a positive reference should the hiring manager contact them.

Example: “I was excited to learn of this job opportunity from my former colleague, Alex Johnson. He and I have worked closely together for many years, most recently on a complex data analysis project at J.J. Manufacturing. He thought that I would be a good match for this position on your team.”

3. Lead with an impressive accomplishment  
Write an attention-grabbing opening paragraph that leads with an impressive achievement and features quantifiable results. It's important to make connections between how you added value at a previous job and how you can apply it to the new role. Think of one particular accomplishment that relates especially well to the job.

Example: “Last month alone, I more than doubled J.J. Manufacturing's social media followers and ran two successful ad campaigns that generated $25,000 in revenue. I'd love to bring my expertise to organically expand your social reach and deliver ROI as the social media manager at your company.”

4. Explain what you like about the company  
Begin your cover letter with evidence that you've done your research. If the company you're applying for was recently in the news, mention it in the opening line and tie it into why you admire the company. To avoid sounding insincere with your compliments, bring up a specific event, fact, notable statistic or award the company recently won.

Example: “I was inspired when I saw that Yukon Industries was featured in Excel Magazine last month for its commitment to renewable energy and reducing waste in the workplace—all while experiencing triple-digit revenue growth. With my track record of reducing costs by 30% and promoting greener workplaces, I'm excited about the possibility of taking on the account executive role to expand your company's growth and work toward a more sustainable future.”

5. Express passion for what you do  
Passion is one of the greatest driving factors behind success. Since hiring managers are looking for candidates who can be advocates for their company and come with a strong work ethic, starting off by expressing your passions and motivations is a good attention grabber. Choose one or two factors that accurately and concisely depict your passion for your career. Explain why these passions make you a valuable candidate.

Example: “I've been passionate about writing since I was the editor-in-chief of my middle school newspaper. Throughout my 10+ years of experience, I've channelled this passion into a personal blog with 20,000+ monthly readers and a writer's workshop I founded for inner-city teens. I believe my passion for writing would make me an excellent copywriter at Yukon Industries.”

6. Tell a creative story  
Although your cover letter is a professional document, it's usually okay to include some humour, charisma and creativity, as long as it's appropriate for the specific job and company. Hiring managers can receive hundreds of applications, and they are looking for something that catches and keeps their attention. Do some research on the company culture, examine the tone of the job posting and use your own judgment when going the creative route.

Example: “It was exactly two hours before a critical meeting with one of our biggest clients—and my manager had just asked me to completely redo our entire sales pitch. Under this time crunch, I reworked our pitch from the ground up, collaborating with teams across several departments to deliver a completely new presentation on time. The best part? Our client loved the pitch, and we closed the sale within 30 minutes.”

7. Include a belief statement  
Impress the hiring manager by opening up with a short and impactful belief statement that mirrors the organization's values and goals. To match your belief statement to the company's mission and values, look at its website. Most companies list their mission statements or objectives on the "About Us" page.

Example: “As a teacher, I believe every student deserves the opportunity to learn at their own individual pace, let curiosity direct their learning and participate in hands-on activities that encourage growth, especially in STEM.”

8. Describe what you can do for the business  
One of the best ways to get the hiring manager's attention in your opening is to show how you can contribute to the company. Relate your accomplishments and qualifications to the business to make yourself valuable. Reread the job description to see if there are specific responsibilities or skills you can write about when you start your cover letter.

Example: "I was eager to apply to this role when I saw that you're looking for a retail manager who can increase sales. With my degree in retail and sales management and my experience as a retail associate, I believe I can target ideal customer demographics and plan campaigns that drive more foot traffic into your store. I'm looking forward to working and growing with Yukon Industries while helping you reach a wider audience."

Tips for starting your cover letter  
Follow these tips to ensure the beginning of your cover letter is powerful:  

Keep it concise. Your entire cover letter should be relatively short, only about a page. That way, you can keep the employer's attention throughout. A short opening paragraph should be enough to get the hiring manager's interest.
Use numbers when applicable. If you include accomplishments in your opening, try to quantify them to better impress the hiring manager. Using numbers to detail your qualifications in your opening also helps put your work into perspective. For example, you can write that you helped improve customer satisfaction by 16% in the last quarter.
Use keywords. Look for keywords in the posting that you can add to your opening. Words like "team player," "driven" and "self-starter" are words to look out for. If any of them describe your work ethic or characteristics, include them in your cover letter.
Be descriptive and strong. Action words can make your opening stronger. Try to include words like "generate," "deliver" and "execute" to show you're a strong candidate.
Personalize each cover letter. Every cover letter you send should have an opening that targets the company. A personalized opening shows you took the time to make a unique cover letter and that you're truly interested in that specific role. Once you finish writing a new opening, proofread it to ensure it's free of spelling and grammatical mistakes.

# How to Assure Quality?

Approach #1: The process control from sample log-in till reporting.  
* Log-in:  
1) typo of sample ID.  

* Sample preparation:  
1) missed surrogate standards, internal standards.  

* Instrument analysis:
1) Type dilution
) Group every 15 samples into batches. Insert QC samples.  
) Set warning limits.  
) QC samples: a standard at low concentration, duplicates, spiked sample,   

* Data process:  
) copy and paste a cell in which there is formula.   
) Alternatively use VBA.  


Approach #2: Tricks
* Use surrogate standards, internal standards.  
* Use QC samples.

# 3.01.01 Behaviour Questions


## Teamwork

**Work together**  
case: prepare for external audit. micro lab, wet chemistry lab.  meeting, break down to-do list, follow up, solved concerns, plan (A AEL)


---

## Difficult Situations

**Work with Difficult People**    


Difficult people: Chantelle Kryschuk  
Why: challenge supervisor for no good reason.  
Case: ICP QC results were not good.  
Seek help from peer.  (case: Chantelle, ICP QC failure, got Randy on board)
Seek guidance from supervisor. (case: results are always lower than regulatory limit, they donot care the quality.  I ask manager)


**Handle Different Opinion**  

It depends on different situations.  
Point: respect, communicate, be assertive, be proactive, do not be self-centered    

situation #1: [AECL] with my manager Mike Attas. different opinion of hiring a QA officer.  express my opinion and respect his decision.    

situation #2: [AECL] with my manager Pam Yule. overlooked safety when running a meeting.  

situation #3: [AECL] with Randy Herman. the way of building linear regression model, concentration on y-axis, instrument response on x-axis.  Leave it.  

situation #4: [AECL] with Kent Feluschko. Approach of GC/MS training.  

situation #5: [LifeLabs] express my understanding of team and relationship to my lab director.  


**Handle Stress in Business** 
It depends on situation.

Situation: Heavy workload, tight due date  

Solutions:   
1) prioritize workload, clarify expectation, ask for bank time or over time.  
2) Reassign tasks.  
3) Work smart.   
4) Planning and teamwork.  
5) Hire temporary workers.  
6) Cooperate with others' time/schedule.  


**Handle Stress in Relationship** 

Some stress come from personality.  Go and take training (Toastmasters), seek consulting (wellbeing) from Morneau Shepell.  

---

## Change management
Case #1: Implement LIMS at Testmark.  

Case #2: Balance interface program (AECL), get support from my manager, get buy-in from a couple of staff for try, persuaded others and solved their concerns.    

Case #3: [LifeLabs] implement R, Shiny

---

### Innovation
Case #1: VBA at AECL.  


---

## Time management
Case: 2015, PT, revised QA manual, CALA accreditation body audit,  

---

## Multitasks

It is about planning, organizing, communication, 

---

## Failure 
case: method comparison, communicate with the boss who knows little about technique.  
solution: learn data visualization.  

### 完不成既定计划，怎么办？
Ask permission to take overtime, to bank time, to prioritize tasks, to keep update on progress.  

I won't fall through crack.  

case: my boss at TOTAL, communicate with him ahead of time, donot wait until the due date comes.


---

## Make decision when info are not completed
If it is safety related. it is easy to make decision.  
No decision is not acceptable, communication must be involved, risk must be assessed.  


---

## Strength and Weakness

### What are your strengths?  
1) Setup myself up as an example of achieving goal with all efforts,  
2) Good at planning and following up the process,  
3) Follow the compliance.  
) Organization

### What did others say about your strength?
1) Fairness. Stephanie at AELabs   
2) 

### What did others say about your strength as a leader?
Goal-oriented.  got commend of 'slave drive'.   
solution: I need to adjust the way I deliver the message according to the culture.  


### What did others say about your weakness?
1) hold them accountable, slave driver.   


---

## Leadership 
Note: MBA talks about the whole picture of what-to-do, the work flow. However, I need to motivate people to achieve it. 

My interpretation of leadership is that I can lead a change for good.  It is not necessary to be under the spotlight or at the leader position.  
I used sandwich method to deliver constructive feedback.  

Note: build leadership through volunteer job.  

---

## What would you do at the very beginning?
Help in data flow.  
know each other, meet them one on one.  
Understand the data flow   
Understand hurtle in the operation   
Provide clear expectation  

---

## Management/behaviour questions

Note: lead by example, decision making, 

When attending an interview with Maxxam (BV), they asked me what others said about your strength.  I replied that I was fair and detail oriented.  The response would be okay for the job without having management responsibilities.  


### 组织思路
管理那些事该如何组织成一段文字（搭出一个架子）呢？  
首先，谈事情。制定计划、实施方案。MBA是一个好用的框架。  
其次，谈如何做事情。如何有效做？ 包括有效激励员工，不断地提醒目标（目标导向）。
我是哪种管理风格？


For the management role, their goal is to ensure the group to achieve the goal.  It is about:
1) how to setup a goal / expectations,  
2) how to plan and take actions,  
3) how to hold accountability,  
4) how to achieve the goal.    



### Manager's Strengths and Weakness

#### What Are Your Manager's Strengths/Weaknesses?
1) Mike Attas: steward leadership to learn, loss control which leave room for development  
2) Karen Ross: clear expectation, but a hard marker 

#### <a href = "https://www.careeraddict.com/answer-what-are-your-manager-s-strengths-weaknesses">What Are Your Manager's Strength and Weakness </a>
"My former boss was very detail-oriented, to the point where he would step in and help me with every little project. While I found it bothersome, I eventually realised that it was a strength and began to learn from it. Since my attitude shift, I've discovered that I'm much more like him in my ability to focus on the small details that often slip through the cracks."  
Tip: Think about what it was that made your previous boss a good or bad boss. Spin it in a way that you don't really talk about the boss' problems, but more about how you overcame your personal problems with the boss and are now a better employee because of it.  


### How did you manage the team?
) Goals, objectives oriented.
) Get to know them. Build trust in relationship by showing competence, delivering work on time, be fair.  Case: Randy Herman allowed me to check reports.
) Listen and observe carefully, before making changes.  
) Support and collaborate.  
) Figure out how your team likes to receive and give feedback.  

————————
Reference: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUpu1Xdcctg">Manage Difficult and Older Employees</a>  
Note: I should have watched this video before joining in Waterloo lab.  


### How did you influence people?
The goal is to achieve goals.  


### How did you motivate people?
Whole day wage for work worth a couple of hours when coming on weekend (Testmark).  
Redeployed staff from lab to customer service (Testmark).  
Send for training.  
Maintain relationship  


## Number of direct reports
AEL: 4+: Elisa, Hannah, Rebecca, Deanna, plus casual worker (Sarah)

AECL: 4+: Paul, Kent, Chantelle, Nicole (Later Brent P.), plus retiree (Randy)



---
## Misc.

### Complicated problems
Note: The employer may look for what factors I have considered.  

It would be easy to deal with some operational concerns in the private sector, but not so in the public sector.  I considered policy, risk, reputation, union agreement. needs lots of conversations from stakeholders.  



### What to do when policy does not make sense?
Policy is made for business' benefit, not in favor of individual.  
Policy of taking sick leave when going to Winnipeg for a doctor appointment.  Clarify it with manager.  Implement it no matter what resistance I encounter.  Be fair to everyone.  
However, there is room for improvement in policy.  We need to raise voice.


### What to do when staff bad mouth the supervisor?


### Work ethic
At AEL, I ran the business as if it was my own business.  
At Atomic Energy of Canada, I showed integrity at last days.



## Effective interpersonal relations
Theory: “Effective” means better communication, theory of “circle of influence”.
Situation:
#1: 


## Flexibility 
Theory:  
Situation:  
1) re comply with changes in policies and procedures: use ImpAct to store ‘non-conformance’ items after 2013 audit.
2) re comply with changes in policies and procedures: change to applying significant figure.
3) Adapts well to ambiguity and operational stress: short of one analyst (Paul) in 2014.

## Initiative
Situation:
#1: re willing to perform tasks outside your regular duties: contact CALA.

## Integrity

# Organizational skill will cover

<!--chapter:end:Part_03_Behaviour_Q/Section_3.03_Organization_skills/001-Organization_will_cover.Rmd-->

# Communication Skills

Guidance:
1) Ask the stakeholder what is your preference.  

2) made mistakes, and learned.
Case #1: Jan Palaty, KISS (Keep it stupid simple), short forms, meet needs, no time to digest.

3) everyone loves visualization.

<!--chapter:end:Part_03_Behaviour_Q/Section_3.04_Effective_communication/010-Communication_Skills.Rmd-->

# Troubleshooting Guidelines

It depends on the nature of problems/trouble  

1) LifeLabs: problem/trouble: short of enzyme, solution: find an alternative.  
2) LifeLabs: problem/trouble: lost at SPE (which affected sample prep recovery), solution: do experiment.  
3) LifeLabs: problem/trouble: isomer (co-eluent), solution: do experiment (mobile phase modifier).  
4) Lifelabs: problem/trouble: peak location identification.  solution: do experiment (change concentration).  
5) AECL:     problem/trouble: PT failure, solution: investigate standard stock, overlaid peaks.  
6) AECL:     problem/trouble: ghost peaks, baseline drift, solution: instrument vendor advice, experience, start with easy solution.  



Problems I have encountered:  
1) We failed PT for a couple of compounds out of 32 compounds.  
2) Source contamination:  
$~$ * Impurity of carrier gas. (high argon or nitrogen in Helium)  
$~$ * Leak at interfaces along the column connections.  
$~$ * O-ring  
4) Purchase of customized standards.  
5) Instrument performance: such as ghost peaks, tailing peaks,  

How did I find the problems:  
1) routine daily check (air and water check)  
2) PT failure  


Preventives:  
) establish a reference point.  
) monitor the instrument response of all standards.  
)   

Tool kits:  
test kits

# CGC Chemist 2016.07

## Effective interactive communication (level 3)

Response: Effective Interactive Communication is transmitting and receiving information clearly and communicating actively to others by considering their points of view in order to respond appropriately. It includes receiving information, understanding, and responding openly and effectively in interactions with others.  There are many theories out there about how to interact with others effectively.  I find the most effective tactic is to hold my tongue and listen more.  The number 2 tactic is that I cannot change people, but I can change myself.  I could change the way of delivering messages so that the intent of my communication will equal its effect; I could be mindful of the right time and the personality of the people when delivering messages.

Being a team player (level 3)

Response: Stephen Covey said “What we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do”.  I do my best to live this quote.  I want to be authentic and transparent, no hidden agenda when working together to deliver analysis service.  I want to build others when building myself.  With working together with the team members, they will know what I am.  This is my way of building trust with others.  Cooperation, problem-solving, be respectful, and effective communication come along as by-products.



Adaptability (level 3)

Response: Volunteering was rare in China before 2004 when I moved to Canada.  Volunteering was a new thing at a job finding club when I immigrated to Canada.  I was told to build up networking through volunteering.  It seems people take advantage of it for personal interests; I have not obtained any jobs through volunteering anyway. It was not until I relocated to Pinawa that I became involved in volunteer work. I started with helping in the company’s parade float for years, what motivated me was not my personal interests, but becoming plugged into the community.  In recent years I have been volunteering at the community library on a regular basis and at the “Relay for Life” event.  I do build a network, but the most important thing is that I connect to the community, I know what is going on in life, and I feel I am a part of it.



Initiative (level 3)

Response: Not long after I joined in AECL, the technologist who used to run GC/MS decided to retire in 2010.  I voluntarily asked my supervisor to look after the analysis.  I believed I had confidence to take over the analysis.  Once I got permission, I started from scratch.  I established an annual service contract; I developed a VOC analysis method; I conducted a few experiments of analyzing sVOC using SPME technology.  I passed the CALA PT right after validation was done.



## Planning, organizing, and coordinating (level 2)

Response: We had a teen age girl come and lived with us since last August.  She is my wife’s niece who went to grade 9.  English is the barrier she must overcome before going to grade 11.  We discussed with her this year about the plan and actions.  Both she and we agreed to grasp vocabulary of a book by the end of the year 2016, which was recommended by the English teacher.  Thinking about synergy, one of 7 habits of highly effective people, I organized a meeting with the teachers and the EAs of the school; I also chatted with a neighbour who has helped out.  I adjusted expectations according to feedback.  The EAs of the school setup a schedule to help her phonetics first; the neighbour planned to go over the book; and I will make a list of words that she must grasp.  I expect she could grasp most of the vocabulary by the end of August; and go over the vocabulary for a couple of times before the end of the year.

Case:  
at personal level:  
experiment at Lifelabs,  
plan experiments,  

at team level:  
goal: external audit, do routine analysis  
planning: put it as a new priority


Written communication (level 2)

Response: Different types of written documents require different tactics, for example an operating procedure requires simple and straightforward sentences.  The author tries to avoid sentences with passive voice.  Email may not always be the best communication because there may be a chance that the receiver may misinterpret the message without getting your tones and facial expression.
One weakness in my written communication is grammatical errors, such as missing the article “the”.  I have been improving my written communication by preparing meeting minutes for our group since 2011 and minutes for the Toastmasters club I participate in since 2015.  I have mentor to review my minutes by correcting grammatical errors.  I make fewer mistakes now.

# 5.01.01 Lesson Learned: Interview Tips

Keep interactive conversation by asking "Am I clear?", "Do I answer your question?"  

<!--chapter:end:Part_05_Interview_Experience/Section_5.01_Lessons_Learned/001_Lesson_Learned.Rmd-->

# 5.02.01 LifeLabs: Interview Preparation

I should prepare:  
1) Introduce yourself, why are you a good fit?  
2) Troubleshooting guidelines (thinking, diagnose, creative thinking)  
) List of VOCs, sVOCs.  
) Quality control and assurance.  
2) VBA case studies.  
3) leadership style / influence style  
4) peak season in control (time management, seasonal workers, cross-training, overtime, banktime, efficiency)  
5) FDA guidelines

I think Jan would ask:
) technical questions: 
* my work,  
* method development and validation
) quality assurance questions:  
* assure quality  
* possibility of reduce amount of QC samples?  
) lab management questions  
) behaviour questions  
) data/ VBA questions  
) FDA guidelines


## Introduce Yourself

I have 12 years of production lab experience using instruments including GC/MS and IC (Ion Chromatography) from Aug 2004 up till Oct. 2016. I worked at Accuracy Environmental Laboratories, Testmark, and Atomic Energy of Canada. I developed a method to determine petroleum hydrocarbons with GC/FID in soil matrixes, and a method using GC/MS with static headspace technique to determine 32 VOCs in aqueous matrixes. I also did research and development of different SPME fibers to determine four groups of semi-VOCs in aqueous samples.

At Atomic Energy of Canada, according to the union agreement, I can only run instruments for method development and validation. Therefore, I learned VBA and developed about six VBA programs to streamline data processing. I also learned Visual Studio.

I also had supervisory experience. There were 4+ under my supervision at Testmark, 4+ under my supervision at Atomic Energy of Canada. At testmark, I was running the show. I was involved in team restruction, motivated staff, monitored TAT, and so on. I ran the business like my own. At Atomic Energy of Canada, I was delegated as a section head. I managed lab performance and staff performance, looked after quality system, and safety practice.

I take pride in my job. I made lots of achievements before and I expanded my skills during my career. I enjoy lab work and data analysis. I believe all I have done before make me be prepared for this job at Lifelabs. It would be my dream job, that is why I applied this job.

Life doesn't always go according to plan. The federal government decided to operate Atomic Energy of Canada under GOCO (Government Owns and Contractor Operates) model. The laboratory service was closed off in 2016. While I am preparing for a professional job, I self-learned R online, looked after my dad during his last days, and did lots of voluntaries to the community. One of voluntaries is to deliver medicines and grocery to the seniors.

As a person, I take my job seriously. I put my best efforts to the job as if I work for myself. 1) I built the reputation of commitment to team success. My supervisor at Atomic Energy of Canada can attest that in a written reference letter. 2) I am a good team player. I liked the following three quotes a lot. Quote #1: There is no "I" in the word team. Quote #2: Light the candle rather than curse the darkness. Quote #3: the strength of the chain is determined by the weak of the link. I used them to guide me at work.


## Why do you want to work here?

1)  It all started with googling "using R in Chemistry field". I got connected with Dan Holmes. Mass Spectro, data analysis. But Dan did not introduce this job opening.

2)  After I did homework, it sounds like a dream job. reducing typing, integrate peaks automatically. all are what I am interested in.

3)  Your job post mentioned VBA that I have not seen often.

4)  plus I will work with talented people, people having 15 years in MS, I believe there will be synergy effect.


## Questions prepared to them

How would you evaluate my performance the position?

What do you like the best about working for LifeLabs?

I see myself run instruments, generate reports, populate data, troubleshooting, method development in the night shift. What are difference between technologist's responsibilities and scientist's responsibilities?

What are supervisory responsibilities? I imagine it would be coordination position, no authority. approve timecard? performance review?

What is your expectation for my probation period?

Would you need the letter of reference? a copy of recognition award?


## Amendments

) My strategy of method development: shorter running time, maintain good quality.

what did I do at AECL? Focus on GC/MS work, method development and validation, data processing, data review, supervision, quality assurance, lab operation.

**MS specialty**
At AECL, I developed a method using GC/MS with static headspace technique to determine 32 VOCs in aqueous samples. I did validation by following American Public Health Association guidelines in the "Standard Methods for the examination of water and wastewater". The guidelines are similar to CLSI C43-A2(GC/MS) and C62-A (LC/MS) according to the table of content. I also did research and development of different SPME fibers to determine four groups of semi-VOCs in aqueous samples. As the chemist of the lab, I was responsible for inorganic analysis as well.

I used cartridges for oil and grease testing in aqueous samples. (EnvirElut 1664 cartridges vs Elut Plexa Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridge)

**Management**
Besides technical management, I was delegated as the section head to manage routine lab operation. I had weekly toolbox meeting with coworkers, I met my manager every week. I setup performance evaluation system using S.M.A.R.T. tool. Due to the requirements of union contracts, I can't run instruments as a professional. Therefore, I led **six** VBA programs to process data. It turned out to be a proactive response to busy time in year 2015.

**My daily responsibilities**
review data, monitor instrument performance while authorizing reports,

**VBA projects**
I did **six** VBA projects. hightlight of anomally in Masshunter.

I intended to do **three** VBA projects (calculate uncertainty estimation at different concentration segments, generate Word report from Excel, and generate control charting on the spot), I wish I would have chance down the road.

**Hobby** Rowing in summer, cross-country skiing in winter.

## What I would do?

) a database of audit finding for training purpose and preventive actions.
) Control charting (real time)
) Reporting data in Excel with Visual Studio
) measurement uncertainty estimation at different concentration segments.
) embed VBA into LIMS.

## Conclusion in Interview

Thank you very much for your time. I believe that my experience in **mass spectrometry, data processing, and supervision** makes me a good fit to this job. I believe if you do hire me, you will see an positive impact on the team, such high-through put. Thank you very much.

# 5.03.01 UBC Soma: Background



## Kiran Soma Background
Kiran Soma ^[https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/behavior-research-at-the-root-of-cattell-fund-projects]
The University of British Columbia

My research examines the effects of steroids on behavior, the brain, and the immune system, particularly steroids that are locally synthesized within the brain and immune system. During my sabbatical, I will expand my expertise in steroid profiling via mass spectrometry. This is an emerging and high-impact technique in behavioral neuroscience. I established a cutting-edge mass spectrometry system at the University of British Columbia in 2016 and will maximize the potential of this system by visiting the lab of Fernand Labrie of the pharmaceutical company Endoceutics and the lab of Karen Chapman of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Both have world-class mass spectrometry facilities and novel techniques for measuring steroids in the brain, including mass spectrometry imaging to reveal where steroids are located in situ. I will refine my mass spectrometry protocols to characterize the suites of steroids present in the blood, brain, and immune tissues of rats and mice. I will pay particular attention to **androgens**, **estrogens**, and **glucocorticoids**. It will be especially interesting to determine whether different suites of steroids are present in blood versus **tissues**. These studies will fundamentally change our ideas about how the brain and immune system are regulated. Traditionally, neuroscientists and endocrinologists have focused on systemic steroid signals in the blood, but more recent studies suggest that this is only the tip of the iceberg, with much of the regulation occurring locally within the tissues themselves. This insight has major implications for understanding normal brain and immune function, as well as for **steroid-sensitive diseases** such as **Alzheimer’s disease** and depression.

# 5.09.02 MALDI-TOF Interview Preparation

focus on:  
1) what am I doing now? (What I have achieved?)
2) only show interest about their work.
3) potential common interest: data engineering, data analysis.

NOT focus on: whether I am a good fit.  This would be a wrong direction.


## What I am doing now at Burnaby?

1) Built a 'database' of CHI data in csv format, 64MB, data in 2021-Jan to 2021-August with VBA and Rstudio.  Shiny app interface and interact with csv files.  
2) The CHI operation was stopped due to lack of enzyme for hydrolysis at the end of August. I ran about 20 experiments of evaluating another vender's product, and studying possibility of a couple of alternative approaches.  
Automation.  
3) Everday was a long day, but I am not tired of doing what I am interested in. I use design of experiment tool, VBA, Pivot Table, R, and ANOVA in these experiments.  

5) There are four of us in medsci team of mid low chemistry, Jan, Kevin, Huey, and I. Each of us has strength.    

## Your weakness?
Do more experiments.  Encounter more problems. Gain more experience.  


## Your long-term plan?
5) my future plan.  
  5.1) Automate data process in method development with R, multi-analytes.  Be more efficient.  
  5.2) Be expert in Design of experiment.  
  5.3) Data engineering, database.  
  5.4) visualization.  
  5.5) Shiny app.  
  5.6) Do more experiments.  
  5.7) Chromatogram and spectrum raw data analysis (peak detection, peak integration)  
  5.8) Databases of audit finding for training purpose and preventive actions.  
  


## My previous experience.
[Kevin So commented that I should not put steroid glucuronides in tables because the SPE program evaluation is only for steroid sulphates. This tells me the principle of focusing, and that it applies to resume preparation.]  

1) developed 6 modular pipelines for quantitative analysis with VBA in Excel.  
2) I developed a method to determine petroleum hydrocarbons with GC/FID in soil matrixes, and a method using GC/MS with static headspace technique to determine 32 VOCs in aqueous matrixes.  
3) 12 years of production lab experience in Canada using instruments including GC/MS and IC (Ion Chromatography) from Aug 2004 up till Oct. 2016.  
4) Automation in sample preparation and data analysis pipeline.

5) review data, monitor instrument performance while authorizing reports,   

As a person, I take my job seriously.  I put my best efforts to the job as if I work for myself.  1) I built the reputation of commitment to team success.  My supervisor at Atomic Energy of Canada can attest that in a written reference letter.  2) I am a good team player.  I liked the following three quotes a lot. Quote #1: There is no "I" in the word team.  Quote #2: Light the candle rather than curse the darkness.  Quote #3: the strength of the chain is determined by the weak of the link.  I used them to guide me at work.    



**Hobby**

## What I would do?
) a database of audit finding for training purpose and preventive actions.  
) Control charting (real time)   
) Reporting data in Excel with Visual Studio  
) measurement uncertainty estimation at different concentration segments.

The position is chemist, but there are responsibilities attachment.  

I did not do well in the interview, because I gave them impression that I am a good employee.  Just like what Hongwen commented to my cover letter when applying the job at UBC ACL.

**Q01: Tell me about yourself**  

**1st layer of story**  
It is my cover letter.  

**2nd layer of story**  

It will be the in-person interview.  

I would say this:

When I finished postgraduate degree, I did not know what to do.  My dad introduced me to a blind fortune-teller. He saw me working in an university campus.  I put it behind as time went by.  When I immigrated to Canada, I had one chance of teaching a couple of courses in a community college.  The courses were related with water sampling, analysis, and associated regulatory compliance which my job covered.  At that job, I managed 10 staff for a couple of years.  I then moved to Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL).  I was delegated to oversee the lab operation.  I supervised 5 staff.




I laughed at the fortune-telling ever since I heard it.  I do wish it would come true this time. 

change management, transition

My supervisory journey started at Testmark.

I managed xx people at Testmark. Commercial environmental laboratory testing service. my goal is to  run the laboratory operation smoothly during the transition to deliver results on time.  

When I got the job at AECL, I was delegated to oversee the environmental laboratory section for 4 years.  xx people at AECL.  my goal is to assist the branch manager to oversee all aspects of operation and to provide service for decommissioning project and routine environmental monitoring to meet nuclear regulatory compliance requirements.

I have encountered many challenges at different working environment, so I could develop solutions to challenges in your laboratory operation.  

I also have wide-ranging experience in instrumental analysis.  Head-space GC/MS, LC-MS/MS.


**3rd layer of story**  
Training at AECL on Leadership.  1) Beuwolf, character; 2) 7 habits of highly effective people.  golden eggs.  
I took the initiative, and consulted with friend, and the volunteering event was launched. [refer to the men's Monday group meeting at Pinawa Alliance Church]

The score will take care of itself.  

Supervise millennial, get collective involvement.  

**Support links**

**Q#02: How did you manage the lab?**  

**My vision/expectation**  
I have **high expectations** on myself and lab operation. That helped me to setup performance objectives/goals. 

Principle #0: plannning and performance management by setting up S.M.A.R.T objectives.  
case: KPI. **S**pecific, **Measureable**, **A**chieveable, **R**easonable, **T**imely manner.

**A**chieveable: something that is not beyond person's capability too much.  

**Follow up, provide constructive feedback, and encouragement**  
business analysis  
provide what they need. case: automate data processing.  

**give hands to help them, provide tools**  

**continuous improvement**  
Plan for process optimized, such as automate repetitive work. save us from stress when handling multi-tasks. 

**when reinforce unpopular policy**  
Be an example.  


**when proposing change**  
be on the same side with them.  Not rush to change.  


**
Principle #01: Be brave, and setup myself as an example.  
Story of Beowulf, - quite a character.  Be accountable for performance, mistakes.  

It is about to deliverables management.
Principle #02: Planning, follow-up, troubleshooting  

**S**ituation #1: year 2015. external audit.  

**T**ask and **A**ction:   
1) Planning. prepare a schedule. assigned tasks.  
2) Follow-up. Ask questions: where we are? What need do we need?  
3) troubleshooting. develop solutions to problems.  cannot submit quality manual on-time..  

**R**esults:  
1) get company-wide acknowledgement award.  


**S**ituation #2: backlog samples.


Lesson learned: beneficial by streamlining data processing.

### different management styles to execute plan and monitor achievment
There were two stages of managing the lab, and they were different.  The first stage is when I was in AEL, commercial lab environment, the management approach is straight forward, and top-down management. Monetary is the only way of motivation. I did works that colleagues did not do after hours.  The bad thing about it is I did not realize that I should listen feedback from staff.
The second stage is when I was in AECL.  It was a people-oriented culture.  Colleagues wanted to get involved in the decision-making process.  I adapted to the culture.  I built relationship, I listened others. servant leaders. Leadership training. 


Principle #04: Build trust in 360 degree relationship
Why it is important?
1) Help to make change, remove barrier.
2) Build ally.


## How would you manage the lab?

1) Ask how would my superior communicate preferably?
2) 

## What is your weakness?
There is room of persuasion skills for improvement.  When it comes down to persuade others, my preferable approach is to present them the fact rather than words. Sometimes, it worked.   For instance, when implementing an interface software with balance to get the weight data transferred to an Excel file, I encountered resistence from a couple of coworkers.  The excuse was there were not many times we had to transfer data.  What I did was that I demonstrated them how this software made my life easier.    

Sometimes, it did not work. I had to leverage my ally colleague. For instance, when there was a time, I had a different opinion about the data quality with a colleague.  Both sides could not make a mutual agreement.  


## How did you organize?

Situation: quality manual revision  
Goal: revamp the document, get it done in a couple months, and submit it to the accreditation agency.  
Organize what:  
1) Team: Quality officers, time management for review;  
2) My work. Time management, work load management.  commitment.
3) Process.  monitor.  Adjust the path

# 项目经理的面试问题

**问题**：你认为项目经理的主要职责是什么?  

基本职责就是确保项目目标的实现，领导项目团队准时、优质地完成全部工作，输出可交付成果，以结果为导向。  

**问题**：怎样管控项目进度?  

在需求明确的情况下，第一强调计划，第二强调监督，第三强调资源分配(人员分配)；下面分别具体讲一讲:  

计划：根据项目管理计划，把项目用里程碑的方式进行**拆分**，每个里程碑再具体的细化拆分，并分配给响应的开发人员，以每日为单位分配工作量。  

监督：项目成员每天早上上班前**站会**，讲解自己昨天的工作成果和今天的安排，以及是否需要帮助，这么做的好处就是及时的反馈工作进度以及遇到的问题，及时发现及时解决，每个人的分工明确，进度透明，会议不会花太多时间，每个人最多也就五六分钟一共半个小时就可以，同时了解了进度和监督偷懒延误的问题。  

资源分配：预留一个技术能力较好的工程师作为技术经理或者技术负责人的角色，少分配一些基础开发的工作，主要作为机动人员，谁有问题就帮谁解决；另外在整个研发时间上预留15%的缓冲时间，预防出现的紧急情况。  

总体来说做好进度管理的两个要素就是，要有计划性，计划清晰再加上监督和快速反馈。  

**问题**：在上一份工作中你学到了哪些项目管理相关的知识，哪些地方提升了
比如：规范会议、项目的变更  

**问题**：在上一份工作中遇到的最大的问题
[这里是你给面试官挖坑的机会，面试官一般会问你最不擅长的点来打压你的工资，这个时候你就要说你最擅长的，一定是你最擅长的点，告诉他这个问题怎么解决，一定是你最懂的 而且经得起推敲的解决方案，他就没有理由可以压你工资]  

第一个问题：之前遇到的是项目相关方经常性变动更需求导致项目延期  

那时候对于项目需求变更管理没有一个很好的理解和解决方案，导致项目计划出现问题。  

（这个可作参考但是最后不要说这里作为分享，因为需求变更导致的项目延期是项目管理的大忌，万一碰到钻牛角尖的面试官很可能会心里存在顾虑觉得你以后也不会妥善处理类似问题；面试的时候说一到两个问题即可）  

首先，应该设立项目需求变更管理委员会，由项目经理和公司高层以及其他项目相关方组成，每次变更需要提交变更申请，经过严格的审核之后才开始修改要变更的需求，并且告知项目相关方由于变更会产生的成本和交付时间的延后，这样做的目的是1.规范操作流程，2.便于需求变更方谨慎准确的提出需求变更，减少因需求考虑不周反复变更的情况，每次变更的内容和所需要的时间形成文件需要由甲方签字确认。同时如果需求变更影响较大，工作量巨大，可能会要求增加项目金额。  

第二个问题：项目团队内耗很高，效率很低  

软件开发是需要团队配合完成的一项工作，例如有一次周末总结会A在做一个接口开发没有做完，B就等着A的接口做完了他才开始工作，B害怕其他工作做到一半又回过头来做当前的接口对接开发，如果存在几种这样的情况那么B的工作效率就很低导致的结果就是其他工作都没有完成又浪费了时间成本。  

解决办法就是每周的总结会变更成每天开例会，讲每个人的工作安排和前一天的工作成果，需要哪些配合大家一起讨论，进度透明化就不用一直等别人做完才开始自己的部分，及时发现及时找出解决方案，有问题大家一起沟通，降低内耗。  

第三个问题：运营的同事越过项目经理直接找到做这个功能的工程师讨论需求问题和一些小的需求的增加导致项目成员的研发时间被打扰无法全身心的投入工作，极大降低程序设计的效率，导致进度延期。  

这是一个沟通管理的问题，没有和相关方确定好项目期间的沟通规则  

补救方式：  
1. 召开项目相关方会议，明确项目期间的沟通规则  

2. 项目经理要承担起保护项目成员的责任，可以让他们避免把宝贵的时间浪费在临时事务上，而且也能让他们工作更加愉快，效率更高；项目成员直面的问题也有可能因为某些问题会演变成流言，让人担心项目重组或裁员，这些流言会大大降低士气。

# 产品经理面试高频20题及答案 

**01 简单的先做个自我介绍**  

好的自我介绍，主要凸显两件事就OK了。  

我是能做产品经理的该怎么证明呢？通过两个维度：  
产能技能（需求分析、用户调研、竞品分析、产品设计、项目管理、数据分析）和  
产品能力（沟通能力、执行能力、逻辑思维、学习能力、领导能力、创新能力）。  

如果你做了很多产品实习或者与产品相关的项目，那可以重点从产品技能的角度阐述，向面试证明我是有相关经验的，可以快速上手；如果没有产品相关的实习或者项目，可以重点从产品能力的角度阐述，像面试官证明，虽然我经历不够丰富，但是我是有潜质做好产品经理的。  
**应用** 产品技能就是硬本事，产品能力就是软实力。  

**02 为什么觉着自己适合做产品经理**  
建议按照如下逻辑框架回答：  
从性格上来说，我是适合做产品经理的，巴拉巴拉XXXXX（举例证明性格适合做产品的点）。  
从能力上来说，我是能够胜任做产品经理的，巴拉巴拉XXXXX（举例证明自己所掌握的产品技能）。  
**应用** 

03 你认为什么是一款成功的产品
每个人对于成功产品的定义是不一样的，所以这一题没有标准答案，但是你一定要有自己的思考框架，建议按照如下方法回答：

从用户的角度：能持续不断的解决目标用户的需求；用户操作简单方便，在使用产品后能够快速的有效的解决问题。
从产品的角度：该产品相较于其他竞品有着独特的优势，产品能够持续不断的迭代以满足目标用户的需求。
从商业的角度：公司的技术层面可以实现该产品，并且可以长期维护，持续完善；该产品可以为公司创造长期的可持续价值，包括但不限于利润，盈利模式，市场价值，战略地位等。
04 产品经理的需求来源有哪些？
这个问题考察你对产品经理工作流程的理解，一般在实际工作中产品经理的需求有4大来源，分别是：

产品需求：产品经理通过数据分析、用户调研、竞品分析等方法验证通过的需求；
运营等业务部门提交的需求：比如以京东为例，服饰业务部/生鲜业务部/家电事业部的运营、采销等人员出于提升业务指标的角度会提出各种需求；
老板的需求：领导从外部合作的角度或者产品战略的角度也会给手下的产品经理提一些需求，比如我还接到过大Boss和老板娘的需求；
Bug修复等：在工作中修复BUG是一件比较常见的事情，影响面大的BUG会走紧急修复流程，不太严重的BUG会走迭代排期。
05 产品经理如何进行需求优先级的排布
在实际工作中，需求来源会非常多，需求池中也会有各种需求，那需求优先级如何规划呢？

一般来说有两个场景：

1）从0到1设计一款产品

这种场景下的需求来源基本上都是产品需求，建议大家去了解一下KANO模型，这个场景下的需求优先级一般来说是：基本型需求>期望型需求>兴奋型需求。



2）在原有产品基础上优化

这种场景的需求来源会非常广泛，可能之前讲到的4中来源都是涉及，那如何排定需求优先级呢？一般按照产品价值和实现成本两个维度。

产品价值可以分为两类：业务价值和用户价值。

价值定义：

业务价值：对应商业类产品，称为商业价值，体现在能给业务带来多少收益。
用户价值：对于使用者来说，能给他带来的价值，比如说能减少操作步骤。
在这种方法下，优先级的排序逻辑是：产品价值大实现成本低>产品价值大实现成本高>产品价值小实现成本低>产品价值小实现成本高。

06 产品经理的工作职责是什么？
产品经理的工作职责主要包含三部分：

产品规划（包含：用户调研、数据分析等需求分析手段）；
产品设计（包含：竞品分析、产品脑图、产品流程图、产品原型图、产品说明文档）；
产品落地（包含：需求评审、需求排期、项目跟进、上线走查等项目管理）。
07 互联网公司典型的商业模式有哪些？
下面是我自己整理的互联网经典5大盈利模式：



08 实习期间有没有和设计/研发争执过，怎么解决的？
参考解析：

具体问题具体分析，如果是UI或产品对产品需求本身存在疑问，可参考如下：

摆数据：证明做这个需求的必要性及完成之后的收益；
讲道理：说明这个需求跟公司整体战略的一致性；
向上沟通：如果基础沟通不能达成一致，可将双方领导拉到一起讨论。
09 需求评审时研发说需求实现不了怎么办？
这种情况在实际工作中会经常遇到，面试官也希望通过这道题考查你随机应变以及解决问题的能力，遇到这种问题建议按照三步走：

站在技术的角度，了解无法实现的原因；
看有哪些可以替代的方案；
评估替代方案对项目本身的影响，如延迟，如若在可接受范围内，适当的妥协。
10 为什么选择我们公司？
这类问题是面试官考查你的职业规划清晰度以及稳定性的一道题，所以建议按照下面三个步骤回答：

第一步阐述自己的职业规划，证明自己喜欢求职的岗位，比如自己想做社交产品，而微信优势国内最强的。

其次，阐述喜欢目标用户的企业文化、工作氛围等，证明自己对这家公司的热爱。

最后，说明自己的稳定性。

举例来说，求职今日头条。

首先，我喜欢策略产品经理这个方向，而今日头条在国内又是最牛的，我坚信做自己喜欢做的事情才会为公司创造最大的价值。

其次，自己特别喜欢头条的创新文化，正是这种文化孵化出了今日头条、抖音、懂车帝、多闪等等系列成功的产品。

最后，我跟女朋友已经商量好以后留在北京发展，今日头条的总部也在北京，所以我会认真工作，今天来面试，希望您能给我个机会，谢谢面试官”。

11 你最常用的app有哪些？请向我推荐一款你最喜欢的？
这一类问题非常常见，回来策略分为三点：

1）所选的APP最好与面试的目标公司或者部门业务相关，这样更容易有话聊。当然这可能对求职者来说要求更高，因为作为应届毕业生来说，很多同学都是海投，如果每面试一家公司都要针对性的准备这道题确实有很大的工作量。但是一切为了好工作，冲鸭年轻人！

2）第二就是分析过程要全。因为这道题考查的一个重点就是分析维度，就是看你对一个产品的分析维度全不全。

3）重点突出在某一个维度上，着重分析该产品做的最好的地方。比如说分析抖音的时候，个性化推荐一定是重点叙述的点；分析网易云音乐的时候歌曲评论功能也一定需要重点阐述。

要回答好这一类题目，一定要非常熟悉产品分析的维度。

完整的产品分析一般包含哪些维度：

定位分析，产品的目标用户是谁？解决了他们什么问题
需求分析，就是目标用户需求的频繁程度和强度如何？是不是刚需高频？产生需求的场景有哪些？
市场分析，就是市场规模什么样的，市场现状是什么样的？市场发展方向是什么样的呀？
竞品分析，就是有哪些竞品，市场份额分别占到占多少，各个竞品切入点的差异等等
视觉分析，整体色调如何？各图标设计的好坏
交互设计分析，导航路径是否清晰？主要功能的触达率如何？
功能分析，这个产品有哪些关键功能，用哪些关键功能满足了用户的核心需求？满足的好不好？有什么优化空间等等。功能分析一定要作为一个重点去进行分析，因为毕竟是一场产品经理的面试。
运营分析，做了哪些运营活动？效果质量如何啊？
在真实的面试场景中，根据产品的特质，要进行有条理、有细节的分析，往往就可以得到面试官的好评。

12 产品上线之后需要关注哪些数据指标？
这个问题主要考察你对数据分析的理解，当然不同类型的产品需要关注的数据指标是不一样的，所以在面试时最好问清楚面试官产品类型。

一般来说产品上线之后需要关注的指标有：

注册用户数：已注册用户的总和
次日留存/7日留存
ARPU：总收入/总用户数，即每个用户的平均收入
日活跃用户数/月活跃用户数
新用户增长率
新用户占比：新用户占今日活跃用户数的比例
用户流失率
渠道转化率
13 产品上线后的种子用户该如何获取
对于种子用户的获取一般通过两种方式：

冷启动：初创公司由于没有钱或者由于还没有经过需求验证阶段，所采用的启动方式，主要包括：通过优质的文章或者熟人推荐进行启动，典型的比较知乎早期的启动方式；
热启动：公司通过大量的资源（人力/资金/流量等）让产品快速启动的方法，比如进行大规模的补贴或者广告推广，早期微博通过邀请明星入驻启动的方法就是热启动。
14 你遇到的最大的挫折是什么？如何解决的？
这是HR面经常会遇到的问题，让很多求职者非常头疼，因为没有好的思路。要想回答好这个问题，我们要先弄清楚HR想要通过这道题了解什么呢？

1、考察你如何看待挫折这件事。就是你认为什么事对你来说算挫折。如果对大多数人都习以为常的事情，你看做是挫折，那就要反思一下是不是自己太玻璃心，抗压能力差了。

2、看你解决问题的思路及能力。在工作中遇到挫折是特别正常的事，重要的是你是如何解决这个问题以及解决的好不好。

3、侧面了解你的学习能力。遇到问题、解决问题之后你能不能从中总结经验教训，同样的问题不会再犯第二次，这就是一个人的自我学习能力。

15 你最大的缺点是什么？
面试希望通过这道题目考察什么呢？

1）看你的缺点是否会影响本职工作

所以在回答此类问题时，一定记住：不能回答对本职工作影响很大的缺点，比如“领导能力差”“逻辑不清晰”“不善于沟通”等等。

2）看你回答问题的思路是否足够有条理

回答此类问题建议按照三步走：

说出自己的一个缺点；
说出这个缺点给自己造成的困扰；
自己是如何努力去克服这个缺点的。
16 你未来的职业规划是什么？
根据中国职业规划师协会的定义：职业规划是对职业生涯乃至人生进行持续的系统的计划的过程，它包括职业定位、目标设定和通道设计三个要素。

所以从这定义中可以看出，职业生涯也不光是指目标设定；想当初自己秋招的时候，面对面试官这个问题我的答案是“希望在工作的1-2年内打好产品基础，争取在2-3年的时间可以做到产品组长，3-5年的时间能成为一个产品负责人。”

这个答案有什么问题？问题在于只说明了目标，没有体现对自己、对这个岗位的认知，也没有说实现方法（即通道设计）。

如果你是一个应届生，可以参考如下的回答框架：

首先，我认真思考过这个问题。我发现产品经理这个岗位需要的能力是A、B、C，而我在学校做过XXX说明我的A能力还可以；在XXX公司实习的时候做过XXX说明我的B能力还可以；同时还做过XXX说明我的C能力也不错，说明我是非常适合产品经理这个岗位的，通过这样深入的分析也坚定了以后要从事产品经理这个岗位的决心。（讲清楚职业定位）

其次，因为我才刚刚毕业，对这个行业还不算很了解，所以我打算这份工作前三年的时间里，积极努力的完成领导交代的任务，积累工作经验，并不断的总结复盘，争取做出一款用户口碑还不错的产品，成为这个领域的专家。

然后，如果自己能力达到一定的程度，而恰巧公司内也有机会的话，三年后我希望可以带团队，成为一个小组长的角色，将自己前三年的工作经验以及自己做产品的心得传授给下属，成为一名优秀的管理者，为公司发挥更大的价值。（这部分在讲目标设定以及通道设计）

17 产品经理的工作流程是什么？
在实际工作中，产品经理的工作流程一般分为如下步骤：

需求收集，具体收集方法如题4所示；
需求池管理，收集来的需求需要放到需求池中统一管理；
需求优先级，需要根据优先级进行需求迭代，具体方法如题5所示；
需求确定，找自己的直属领导确认每一个迭代的需求；
产品设计，使用竞品分析、脑图、流程图、原型图、PRD等方法详细的梳理产品逻辑；
项目管理，使用项目排期表等方式推动项目按时并且保质保量的上线；
数据分析，产品上线之后通过数据分析等方法验证功能/产品是否达到预期效果，如果没有需要如何优化，然后开启另一个版本的迭代。
18 为什么从上家公司离职？
针对这个问题，我建议从三个维度来回答：行业、公司、个人发展。

1）行业

对于传统公司转行互联网的求职者，尤其要重点考虑行业因素。

相对来说，传统行业效率比较低下，节奏比较慢，成长也比较慢。比如有几个转行人就跟我提到过：

“目前我在传统车企做销售领域的战略与运营管理，感觉传统车企没发展，效率低下，文化腐朽。”

“目前在一家事业单位上班，这种地方容易让人变得慵懒，无上进心，不想在年纪轻轻的时候就过上这样的生活”等等不一而足。

而互联网相对来说节奏比较快，工作比较有挑战性，所以自己也可以比较快速的成长。

所以行业方面可以按照如下方法进行叙述：

“我之前的公司是XXX，属于XXX行业。而这个行业当前存在很多问题：1、XXX；2、XXX；3、XXX；而互联网行业跟我之前的行业完全不一样，所以我希望融入移动互联网，这个发展最快，也最有挑战性的行业，这样我也能更快的成长”

2）公司

对于应届生换实习或者互联网行业内部转行建议从这个角度来回答。

任何人都希望在一个有发展前景的公司上班，随着公司一起成长，说不定一不小心就财富自由了；我们也希望在一个有能力的领导手下工作，这样可以在工作上获得更多的指导；当然我们也喜欢在一个氛围特别好的团队中工作，这样会工作的很开心，而上面三项中的任何一项不好，都有可能成为我们跳槽的理由。

但是在回答这个问题的时候一定要注意，尽量不要说领导的坏话，不然面试官会想，你现在这么说领导，以后离职到下家是不是也这么说我？当然也尽量不要说同事的坏话，不然感觉你是一个团队融入感比较差的人，所以尽量从公司的角度说一些客观存在且自己无力改变的事实。

比如“公司频繁的转型，一直没有找到合适的方向，我的职责也一直跟着变化，导致目前的工作内容与最开始的预期不符，看不到自己的未来，所以想换一家更有前景的公司。”

还比如“目前公司的体量比较小，没有标准的工作流程以及培养体系，而作为新人这些对我以后的发展很重要，所以想找一个更大的平台发展。”

3）个人发展

这个更建议互联网运营、研发、测试、UI等转行人士可以考虑从这个角度叙述；大家同在职场混，为了自己更好的发展确实是一个很正当的理由。

“我从上一家公司离职主要是为了个人发展。通过对自己的深入剖析我发现自己在性格上适合做产品经理，并且能力模型也符合产品经理的岗位要求，所以为了更好的个人发展我打算转行做产品经理；因为我坚信一个人只有做自己最喜欢的事情，才更容易做出好的成绩；但是上家公司不支持内部转岗/没有产品经理岗，所以我打算离职。”

大家可以根据自己的情况，挑选三个维度中的任意一两个进行回答该问题即可。

19 如何看待去大公司上班还是去小公司上班？
这种类型的题目，当然是”见人说人话，见鬼说鬼话“，但是不能只是简单的说自己要去大公司还是小公司这么简单。

回答此类问题，可以按照三个步骤走：

1）阐述自己的职业规划。

2）逻辑清晰的说明大公司和小公司的优缺点：



3）结合对自己的认知，阐述自己想要在大公司/小公司上班的原因。

20 我没有什么问题了，你有什么要问我的吗？
从求职者的角度，面试总共分为三种场景：

感觉自己肯定能进入到下一关；
不太确定能不能进入下一关，是一种模糊状态；
感觉自己肯定挂掉了。
下面我们对每一种场景的回答技巧分别进行说明：

第一种场景：感觉自己肯定能进入到下一关

问一下你最关心的公司情况，作为offer选择的参考。比如求职部门的主要业务方向，新一年的战略规划、研发资源充不充足，产品团队的规模等等；因为这些信息你从网上根本找不到的，而且这是你拿到很多offer之后选择offer的重要依据之一；所以一定不要错过这个机会，任何想要了解的都可以在这个环节提问，不要怕问题多，既然他让你进入下一关，在这个环节都是想跟你多聊的。

第二种场景：不太确定能不能进入下一关，感觉自己表现不错，但是不能从面试官脸上看出什么明确的信息

这时候最好的策略是通过精心设计的问题适当的争取一下。给大家几个参考的方向。

1）体现自己的学习热情，比如可以问“您在工作过程中遇到的优秀的产品经理都是什么样的？他们身上有哪些共同特征？”

2）体现对公司的喜爱，比如“字节跳动这家公司是我特别喜欢的一家公司，创新能力特别强，我是今日头条、抖音的忠诚用户，请问公司内部什么机制导致了这种创新氛围呢？如果加入贵公司，会有机会跟各位优秀的产品经理多交流吗？”

3）体现面试官的能力，比如“我在人人都是产品经理上看过您发的多篇文章，特别佩服，知道您对电商本质有深刻理解，请问像拼多多这样的公司以后会怎么发展？”当然这种方法的可操作性比前两种差一些，需要你认识这个面试官并对他很了解。

4）表现自己的其他能力。比如你对推荐策略有深入的了解，但是面试中没有涉及到这块，你可以说“我对推荐策略有比较多的研究，我可以说一下自己的理解，您给指导一下嘛？”或者你带了一份竞品分析报告，但是面试中没机会展示；你可以说“面试官您好，这是我写的虎牙和斗鱼的竞品分析报告，您能给指点一下嘛？”虽然措辞上是指导一下，但肯定是希望给面试官一种惊喜感的，所以这种情况的前提是你一定对某一个方向了解特别深入或者报告写的特别好，不然很可能会起反作用。

第三个场景就是感觉自己肯定挂掉了。

第一个可以参考的就是面试时间，比如一二十分钟；还比如面试官的态度及表情，如果面试过程中能很明显的看出面试官是不赞同你的很多观点等等。

这时候，当然你也可以用第二个场景中的方法尝试争取一下，但是成功的可能性不高。

比较务实的方法是问一下自己这场面试不好的地点，为下一场面试做好准备；比如可以问“您认为这场面试我表现不好的地方是哪？该如何改进？”或者“这场面试我的哪个问题回答的不好？您认为正确的回答方法是什么？”，即使最终这场面试失败了，但是你依然是有收获的，因为你可以让下一家公司面试变的更好。

以上就是为大家整理的面试常见的20个问题，希望能帮助求职的你们顺利拿下每一轮面试。

Answers to
Behavioral Interview Questions
All answers to behavioral interview questions should be structured around 3 components. The
situation or task in which you displayed the behavior in question, the actions you took and the
results of these actions. The interviewer is asking you to provide a real-life example of how you
have previously used or demonstrated the required job behavior or competency.
The situation or task is the background or context in which you took action. Common situations
in which candidates are required to take action include a change in job responsibilities, demands
made by managers, colleagues and customers and challenges in meeting job requirements.
The actions are what the candidates did or said in response to the the situation and how they did
it. Actions commonly include steps taken to complete a task or project, solving a problem or
overcoming a challenge, making a decision and interacting with managers and customers.
The results are the effects or outcomes of the candidates actions. The changes, consequences
and differences the actions made and if the actions were effective and appropriate.
See what the interviewer is looking for in answers to behavioral
questions that explore the competency or behavior. Use the answer
guidelines to determine appropriate past situations where you have
used or demonstrated the behavior. Prepare and structure your
behavioral example to provide the information the interviewer wants.
Planning and Organizing
The examples you present in answers to behavioral questions that
determine your ability to plan and organize should include the following actions - establishing
clear and realistic objectives, scheduling activities and time parameters to get the job done,
setting priorities, knowing which resources are needed and making the best use of these,
monitoring your progress and adjusting your activity where necessary. Sample behavioral
answer.
Decision Making
Your answers to behavioral interview questions about using your judgment and making decisions
should include the following steps in the decision making process - gathering the necessary
information and facts, using this information to work out possible courses of action to take,
considering alternative courses of action, considering the implications and consequences of
different courses of action and carrying out the most appropriate course of action. Involving the
necessary stake-holders in the decision-making process is another important aspect of decisionmaking.
Sample behavioral answer.
Problem Solving

non-traditional solutions to problems. It is a highly valued competency and employers are more
and more aware of the need for creativity in their workforce in order to be competitive and
successful. Sample behavioral interview answers
What is the interviewer not looking for in answers to behavioral interview questions?
The interviewer wants an actual example from your past. What he or she does not want in
answers to behavioral interview questions are the following:
Vague responses - these include generalizations that do not provide a specific situation. Avoid
using phrases such as "Most of the time...", Usually...", Sometimes..."
Opinions - The interviewer is not asking for your opinion. He or she wants a real-life, factual
example of what you did in a certain situation. Avoid phrases such as "I believe...", "I think...",
"In my opinion..."
Theoretical responses - these answers indicate what you would do rather than what you did do.
Avoid phrases such as "If I had ....", I would have...", "I might.."
Criticism of former colleagues, managers and companies - it is important to provide a
straightforward account of what you did in your behavioral example. Bad mouthing other people
in your answer will only detract from its validity.
Use the techniques for behavioral job interviews and the behavioral interview guide to prepare
thoroughly for challenging behavioral job interviews.

Where do you see yourself five years from now?
"In five years I hope to be working with an employer in an increasingly responsible position, that enables me to utilize my talents and work closely with my colleagues in solving important problems. I see myself taking on new and exciting challenges in an enjoyable environment and hopefully this will be with your company."
***
Describe a major goal you've set for yourself recently.
Give an example of a goal you both set and achieved. Ideally, this should be a professional goal; such as improved time management skills, achieved new performance targets, or learned a new skill. A personal example can also be appropriate if it reinforces your pattern of accomplishments. For example, if you take a great deal of initiative and quickly move into leadership positions, you might use a personal example relating to your recent community work: organized a community walk-a-thon that raised $30,000 in matching funds to purchase new computers for the local library. Talk about results of achieving your goal. This indicates you set realistic goals and that you can focus on outcomes. Select an example that has interesting outcomes related to your efforts. The example should showcase your skills and abilities.

The Best Answers to Tough Interview Questions

Tell me about yourself.
This is really more of a request than a question. But these few words can put you on the spot in a way no question can. Many quickly lose control of the interview during the most critical time- the first five minutes. This is not the time to go into a lengthy history or wander off in different directions. Your response should be focused and purposeful. Communicate a pattern of interests and skills that relate to the position in question. Consider your response to this question as a commercial that sells your autobiography. Provide an answer that includes information about where you grew up, where you went to school, your initial work experience, additional education and special training, where you are now, and what you intend to do next. One of the most effective ways to prepare for this question is to develop a 60-second biographic sketch that emphasizes a pattern of interests, skills, and accomplishments. Focus your response around a common theme related to your major interests and skills. Take, for example, the following response, which emphasizes computers.
"I was born in Canton, Ohio and attended Lincoln High School. Ever since I was a teenager, I tinkered with computers. It was my hobby, my passion, and my way of learning. Like most kids I enjoyed computer games. When my folks gave me a computer as a reward for making honor roll my sophomore year, I mastered DOS, Windows, and WordPerfect within six months. I then went on to teach myself programming basics.
By the time I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to study programming. From that point on, everything fell into place. My life revolved around computing. By my junior year at Syracuse, I decided I wanted to work for a major software manufacturer. That is why I had an internship last summer at FastTrack Software.
I now want to work for a major player so I can be at the forefront of breaking trends and new technology. When my college roommate told me about his start in your department, I hounded him until he helped me get a referral, which brought me here today.
I am prepared to answer any questions you may have about my education and experience."
This response sets a nice tone for starting the interview. The interviewee is able to say a lot within 60 seconds by staying focused. The message is clear: the interviewee has both passion and focus relating to the position. He stays on message and concludes by leaving the door open for additional questions about his education and experience. Unfortunately some candidates get off on the wrong foot by rambling on for several minutes about their childhood, family, hobbies, travels, and interests.
Repeat Key Accomplishment Statements
Throughout the interview you will be asked numerous questions about your attitude and ability to do the job. Whenever possible, talk about your accomplishments in terms of what you did and the results of your actions for employers. Give examples of your effectiveness, which should include specific skills and statistics.

Where do you see yourself five years from now?
This open-ended question is one of the most difficult and stressful ones job seekers face. Employers ostensibly ask this question because they are looking for people who know what they want to do and who are focused on specific professional goals. If you lack goals, you will have difficulty answering this question. Be sure you arrive at the interview with a clear vision of what you want to do today, tomorrow and five years from now. Be consistent with the objective on your resume and the skills and accomplishments you're communicating to the interviewer. Your answer should be employer-centered. For example,
"In five years I hope to be working with an employer in an increasingly responsible position, that enables me to utilize my talents and work closely with my colleagues in solving important problems. I see myself taking on new and exciting challenges in an enjoyable environment and hopefully this will be with your company."
Do not indicate that you hope to start your own business, change careers, or go back to school. Such responses indicate a lack of long-term interest since you do not plan to be around for long. While some may respond that they honestly haven't really thought that far ahead, the interviewer infers that the applicant lacks vision and goals.

Describe a major goal you've set for yourself recently.
Give an example of a goal you both set and achieved. Ideally, this should be a professional goal; such as improved time management skills, achieved new performance targets, or learned a new skill. A personal example can also be appropriate if it reinforces your pattern of accomplishments. For example, if you take a great deal of initiative and quickly move into leadership positions, you might use a personal example relating to your recent community work: organized a community walk-a-thon that raised $30,000 in matching funds to purchase new computers for the local library. Talk about results of achieving your goal. This indicates you set realistic goals and that you can focus on outcomes. Select an example that has interesting outcomes related to your efforts. The example should showcase your skills and abilities.

Now that you've had a chance to learn more about us, what would you change about our company?
Be careful here. Most companies don't want you to come in and shake up the place. At the same time, they don't want someone who says, "Nothing, everything looks great here." Seek a middle ground by focusing on one or two non-threatening issues that may have come up in your discussions. For example,
"From our discussion of the problem with the southwest accounts, I think we should look into the possibility of consolidating them the LA office. However, I think we need to do a thorough cost-benefit analysis of this region before making such a move. We may find the Phoenix office to be more beneficial."
Such an answer indicates you are open to making changes but you also have a certain non-threatening decision-making style. Your response should sound sensible and innovative.  

We all have weaknesses. What are some of your major weaknesses?
This is not the time to confess all your problems nor to confidently say you have no weaknesses. The best way to handle this question is to mention personal weaknesses that are outside the job or a professional weakness that you have already improved upon. For example,
"I have a real weakness for chocolate that tends to go right to my waist! I'm watching my calories carefully these days!" or "I've never been good with accounting. I'm glad this job doesn't involve accounting." Or "I have a tendency to take on too much on my own. I am working on this by delegating more."

What type of decisions do you have difficulty making?
Show that you are generally decisive but mention that there are situations that give you time to pause or you are learning how to better make decisions. For example,
"I sometimes have difficulty choosing between two equally good ideas." or "I used to have difficulty saying 'no' to people until I learned to better set priorities."

What is your biggest failure?
Focus on something outside your work or something that happened on the job that you later fixed. Do not admit to any personal quality that might hamper job performance, such as procrastination, laziness or lack of concentration. Choose something that will not reflect badly on your ability to perform in the given position, such as one that took place early in your career. For example,
"My biggest failure was not being selected as a SEAL because I was diagnosed with night vision problems. When I was 18, all I wanted to be was a SEAL. But I'm glad I didn't, because I may have overlooked an exciting career in information technology" or "When I was working at CL Advertising Associates, I lost the $2 million Jettler account after only six weeks on the job! I felt awful and thought I would be fired. I was determined to get the account back and did after six months. Today the account makes up 1/3 of CL Advertising."

What are the major reasons for your success?
This is not the time to become extremely self-centered and arrogant. Keep in mind that employers are often looking for team players rather than Lone Rangers. A good response to this question may relate to a mentor/and or philosophy of work or the people you work with. Also, use this question as an opportunity to inquire about an appropriate "fit for success" with this company. For example,
"Many years ago I learned an important lesson from Bob Nelson, who was my first supervisor and really became my most important mentor. He told me his secret to success was to 'Look at each day as a new opportunity to be your very best. Set high goals, be honest, never say no, and work with people who share your passion for doing their best.' I've always remembered that advice and try to live it every day. I am very self motivated, determined and honest. I really love what I do and I try to surround myself with people who share similar passions. I thrive on this type of environment. Am I likely to find this environment with your company? Can you tell me a little more about the characteristics of successful people at your company? What do you see as some of the key success factors for this position?"
We're considering two other candidates for this position. Why should we hire you rather than someone else?
Do not be distracted by the mention of two other candidates, you don't know anything about them and they could be fictitious. Focus on what strengths you bring to the table. These should be consistent with the four things most employers are looking for in candidates during the job interview: competence, professionalism, enthusiasm, and likability. Remember, they are looking for chemistry between you and them. Be prepared to summarize in 60 seconds why you are the best candidate for the job. Also, let the employer know you want the job and you will enjoy working with them. A lack of interest in the job may indicate a lack of enthusiasm for the job and them.
How do you spend your free time?
This question may have several purposes. The interviewer may be just curious about your personal life without getting into illegal questions. He may also want to know how well rounded you are in your personal and professional lives. Focus on some of the standard hobbies or activities that most people engage in: golf, tennis, boating, reading, music, opera, collecting, gardening, or cooking. If you are operating a home-based business as a sideline, you may not want to reveal your entrepreneurial spirit-it may indicate you are planning to leave and go solo as soon as the business starts doing well.

Why do you want to work in this industry?
Tell a story about how you first became interested in this type of work. Point out any similarities between the job you're interviewing for and your current or most recent job. Provide proof that you aren't simply shopping in this interview. Make your passions for you work a theme that you allude to continually throughout the interview.
"I've always wanted to work in an industry that makes tools. One of my hobbies is home-improvement projects, so I've collected a number of saws manufactured by your company. I could be an accountant anywhere, but I'd rather work for a company whose products I trust."
How do you stay current?
Demonstrate natural interest in the industry or career field by describing publications or trade associations that are compatible with your goal.
"I pore over the Wall Street Journal, the Times, Institutional Investor, and several mutual fund newsletters. And I have a number of friends who are analysts."
Why do you think this industry would sustain your interest in the long haul?
What expectations or projects do you have for the business that would enable you to grow without necessarily advancing? What excites you about the business? What proof can you offer that your interest has already come from a deep curiosity-perhaps going back at least a few years-rather than a current whim you'll outgrow?
"The technology in the industry is changing so rapidly that I see lots of room for job enhancement regardless of promotions. I'm particularly interested in the many applications for multimedia as a training tool."
Where do you want to be in five years?
Don't give specific time frames or job titles. Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you'd expect in your chosen field or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. You shouldn't discuss your goals in a fields or industry unrelated to the job you're applying for. This may sound obvious, but too many candidates make this mistake, unwittingly demonstrating a real lack of interest in their current field or industry. Needless to say, such a gaffe will immediately eliminate you from further consideration.
"I'd like to have the opportunity to work in a plant as well as at the home office. I also hope to develop my management skills, perhaps by managing a small staff."
Describe your ideal career.
Talk about what you enjoy, skills that are natural to you, realistic problems or opportunities you'd expect in this particular job or industry, and what you hope to learn from those experiences. Avoid mentioning specific time frames or job titles.
"I'd like to stay in a field related to training no matter what happens. I was too interested in business to work at a university, but I believe that teaching is somehow in my blood. I've been good at sales because I took the time to educate my clients. Now I look forward to training the new hires."
Tell me something about yourself that I didn't know from reading your resume.
Don't just repeat what's on your resume. Think of a talent or skill that didn't quite fit into your employment history, but that's unique and reveals something intriguing about your personality or past experience.
"You wouldn't know that I've managed my own small portfolio since I was sixteen, but I believe that it's important for you to understand my interest in investment sales. I've averaged a 12 percent return over the past eight years."
Tell me what you know about this company.
Describe your first encounter or a recent encounter with the company or its products and services. What would be particularly motivating to you about working there as opposed to working the same type of job in a different company? The recruiter will look for evidence of genuine interest and more than just surface research on the company. Reciting the annual report isn't likely to impress most recruiters, but feedback from customers and employees will.
"I served as an intern to a restaurant analyst last summer, so I followed all the steak-house chains closely. What you've done especially well is focus on a limited menu with great consistency among locations; the business traveler trusts your product anywhere in the U.S. I'm particularly interested in your real-estate finance group and expansion plans."
What have you learned about our company from customers, employees, or others?
Describe how your interest has grown from personal dealings with the company representatives. Think creatively in preparing for job interviews. For example, prior to your job interview, speak with retailers or workers at other distribution points about the company's product line. What can they tell you? Give one or two examples of what you've learned to explain why you're interested in this company. What's the most compelling example you can describe to prove your interest?
"I actually called several of the key accountants mentioned in your brochure. Two of the customers I spoke with explained why they continued to buy from you year after year. Your distribution operation is phenomenal. Are there any service improvements you think could still be made?"
Tell me what you think our distinctive advantage is within the industry.
Describe things you believe the company does very well, particularly compared to its competition. Explain how the financial strength of the company is important.
"With your low-cost-producer status and headquarters operation in a low-cost area of the country, you seem in a better position to be able to spend aggressively on R&D, even in a down year compared to your closest rival."
What other firms are you interviewing with, and for what positions?
Often the candidate will try to impress the employer by naming some large firms in unrelated industries with completely different types of jobs. This is a big mistake! What employers want to hear is that you're interviewing for similar jobs in the same industry at similar firms (such as their competitors). This illustrates that you're committed to finding a job in your field of interest and are likely to be a low-risk hire.
"Actually, I've definitely decided to pursue a career as a restaurant manager, so I'm applying for restaurant management-training programs. I've recently had interviews with several other large national fast-food chains, such as Super Burger and Clackey's Chicken."
Do you believe you're overqualified for this position?
Most people don't expect to be asked if they have a great deal of experience. This question could quite easily catch a candidate off guard, which is exactly the interviewer's intention. The candidate doesn't hesitate in answering this question and shows complete confidence in his or her ability.
"Not at all. My experience and qualifications make me do my job only better, and in my opinion, my good design skills help to sell more books. My business experience helps me run the art department in a cost-efficient manner, thus saving the company money. Finally, I think I'm able to attract better freelance talent because of all my industry contacts. My qualifications are better for your company, too, since you'll be getting a better return for your investment. Again, I'm interested in establishing a long-term relationship with my employer, and if I did well, I would expect expanded responsibilities that could make use of even other skills."
What would you do if one of our competitors offered you a position?
The interviewer is trying to determine whether the candidate is truly interested in the industry and company, or whether he or she has chosen the company randomly. Contrast your perceptions of the company with its competitors, and talk about the company's products or services that you've encountered. In the long run, which players do you believe are most viable and why? This is also a good place to ask the interviewer for his or her opinion.
"I'd say no. I'm not interested in other players in this industry. I want to work for Nike because I won a number of races wearing the Nike brand. Because of my positive experience with Nike, I know I'd be convincing selling your product to retailers."
What's your dream job?
This is your ideal chance to sell your aptitudes that fit the job description. Show an interest in finding new ways these skills can be put to use in a new job with additional responsibilities. Tie in the industry, size of company, or other factors where appropriate.
"My dream job would include all of the responsibilities and duties in this position you're trying to fill. I also thrive in a fast-changing environment where there's business growth. Your plans call for expanding internationally during the next year, and this would satisfy one of my ultimate goals of being involved in an international corporation."
What motivates you to do this kind of work?
The interviewer will want to know about your belief in the products or services of the company. Use personal experience to demonstrate your interests and strengths. In an interview for your ideal job, you'd be highly motivated to get paid for working at something you liked. The interviewer will want to know if your natural interests are compatible with its particular job.
"I've been fortunate in my own schooling; I had wonderful teachers. I want to be that same kind of teacher-who not only encourages kids to learn but also sets an example that inspires others to want to teach. In the long run, that's our best chance of turning around the quality of education in this state."
Why should I hire you?
Don't repeat your resume or employment history. Offer one or two examples to explain why you're talking to this particular company. What's the most compelling example you can give to prove your interest? This question often remains unasked, but it's always in the back of the recruiter's mind. Even if this question isn't asked, you should find an opportunity to use your prepared response sometime during the interview, perhaps in your closing remarks.
"My uncle had a company that was a small-scale manufacturer in the industry, and although he later sold the business, I worked there for five summers doing all sorts of odd jobs. For that reason I believe I know this business from the ground up, and you can be assured that I know what I'd be getting into as a plant manager here."
What are your strengths?
Describe two or three skills you have that are most relevant to the job. Avoid clich�s or generalities; offer specific evidence. Describe new ways these skills could be put to use in the new position. If you have to talk about weaknesses, be honest without shooting yourself in the foot-avoid pointing out a weakness that could be a major obstacle in landing the job. For example, it might be wise to mention you barely have the required work experience for the job; the interviewer has surely noticed this much, and then you can explain how you're qualified nonetheless.
"My strengths are interpersonal skills, and I can usually win people over to my point of view. Also, I have good judgment about people and an intuitive sense of their talents and their ability to contribute to a given problem. These skills seem to me directly related to the job. I notice that you require three years' work experience for this job. Although my resume shows I've only two years' experience, it doesn't show that I took two evening college courses related to my field and have been active in one of the professional societies. I also try to gain knowledge by reading the industry's trade journals. I'm certain that my combined knowledge and skill level is the equivalent of that of other people who do have three years' of work experience. I'm also currently enrolled in a time-management course; I can already see the effects of this course at work on my present job."
How do you explain your job success?
Be candid without sounding arrogant. Mention observations other people have made about your work strengths or talents. This question is similar to the question "What sets you apart from the crowd?"
"I never assume our customers are satisfied with our product, so I do my best to follow up with every customer. This feedback has provided valuable insight into the quality and characteristics of our products. The customer, as well, always appreciates this follow-up, especially when something hasn't gone right and you still have the opportunity to correct it on a timely basis. In addition, I'm able to pass on information to our design and production units to help improve both process and product."
Would your current boss describe you as the kind of employee who goes the extra mile?
Be ready to offer proof that you persevere to see important projects through and to achieve important results. Share an example that demonstrates your dependability or willingness to tackle a tough project. If you describe "long hours of work," make sure you demonstrate that the hours were productive, and not just the result of poor time management.
"Absolutely. In fact, on my annual evaluations she writes that I'm the most dependable and flexible person on her staff. I think this is mostly because of my ability to juggle and prioritize. Would you like an example?"
Tell me about a time you didn't perform to your capabilities.
This question forces the candidate to describe a negative situation. Do so in the context of an early career mistake based on inexperience; then demonstrate the better judgment you now have as a result of that learning experience.
"The first time I had to give a presentation to our board, I failed to anticipate some of their questions. I was unprepared for anything other than what I wanted to report. Now my director and I brainstorm all the what-ifs in advance."
How do you manage stress in your daily work?
It might be helpful here to describe a stressful project you've worked on and the specific actions you took to organize each step and see the project through. How do you keep yourself calm and professional under pressure?
"I try to get out for lunch at least once during the week to clear my head. I also have a personal rule that stops me from reacting to a problem until I feel calm about it. I think, then act-but I've learned to do that over time."
How do you regroup when things haven't gone as planned?
Describe a time when some obstacle forced you to change your original plan, but you were still able to achieve the desired result. Did you rally the support of others to make this happen? With hindsight, how might you have better predicted the obstacle?
"I start by trying to imagine the worst possible outcome; then I back up and identify precautions I can take to avoid that scenario. In this way I usually end up with a result close to the original goal. The training example I described earlier is proof of that skill."
Why is service such an important issue?
The interviewer is trying to determine if the candidate understands the importance of customer service in establishing a positive image in the marketplace, and its impact on new business sales. Outstanding customer service is also a great help in establishing long-term clients and repeat business-the profitable company's bread and butter. The longer the relationship, the greater the possibility for profit.
"Service is a major contributor to customer satisfaction. Just as important as, or maybe even more important than, cost. If a customer isn't receiving a level of service that meets or exceeds his or her expectations, that customer won't be a customer for very long. In addition, that customer's experience with your company may affect how potential customers in the marketplace view your company. People do talk and share information. This may affect not only profits but future sales as well. In many instances service may be the one thing that distinguishes a company from the competition. A bad reputation for service may compromise a company's position in the marketplace."
Tell me about a time when you had to deal with an irate customer. How did you handle the situation?
How you react when others lose their temper or become upset is very important in most positions, especially those in service industries. The interviewer will be looking for evidence of your aptitude for work that involves a great deal of contact with the public. Give an example of a time when you were faced with a difficult person and how you handled it. Your answer should illustrate your maturity, diplomacy, and awareness of the needs and feelings of others.
"My customer service position at the telephone company involved dealing occasionally with irate customers. When that happened, I'd try to talk in a calm, even voice, in order to get the person to respond in a businesslike manner and focus on trying to resolve the situation. Most times I was able to rectify the problem and pacify the customer, but I remember one incident in particular in which the caller became verbally abusive. I tried to remain calm and professional and not to let my personal feelings enter into the situation. I didn't respond to the abuse, I just made a not of it and continued to help he customer as best I could. When the abuse persisted, however, I politely asked him to call back and ask for my manager, because at that point I knew I shouldn't resolve the problem."
How do you manage your work week and make realistic deadlines?
To answer this question effectively, describe in detail how you establish priorities, set deadlines, and determine schedules.
"I always reserve two hours of dead time every day to handle any unanticipated problems that may occur. I used to plan for eight or nine hours of project time, but now I find that I'm able to manage my own projects, as well as whatever my boss and staff need from me."
What personal skill or work habit have you struggled to improve?
This question is similar to "Describe a professional skill you've developed in your most recent job." However, here you probably want to discuss an improvement from the earliest days of your career or from your relatively distant past. Make sure you convince the interviewer that this particular work habit is no longer an obstacle.
"I had to learn to say no. I used to be helpful to the point that other staff abused my goodwill. Now I offer to help by countering with something I'd like help on in return. On balance I believe the trade-off is more equitable, and cooperation in our office has improved over time."
What color is your brain?
Be aware that you'll probably be asked zany questions. The point is not to stump you, but to find out what makes you tick. When the standard interview questions are asked, people are prepared, and it's harder for the recruiter to get to know the real person. An advertising recruiter, for example, tries to avoid this. There is no right or wrong answer to this type of question. In fact, the recruiter won't even really care what your answer is. He or she just doesn't want to hear something like, "I don't know, I guess it's blue because that's the way I imagine it." The point is to see how creative you are and how you think. Be sure to explain why you answered the way you did.
"My brain is red because I'm always hot. I'm always on fire with new plans and ideas."
If you got on an elevator where everyone was facing the back, what would you do?
Interviews in creative fields like advertising and graphic design are different from other types of job interviews. Advertising recruiters tend to have a different interview style and process, usually conducting more of a behavioral interview. Recruiters ask questions like these to figure out what your behavior might be in a particular real-life situation.
"I think I'd face the front anyway and say aloud, 'It's really much more comfortable facing forward, you know.' "
What's the most creative or innovative project you've worked on?
Provide examples of your initiative and resourcefulness. Discuss how your leadership skills have helped you accomplish your goals. Give a specific example that shows a creative, new, or unusual approach to reaching your goals.
"During my summer job at Cellular One, I noticed that the sales inquiries were distributed haphazardly to all the marketing assistants in the office. I decided to set up a system grouping inquiries according to region or according to company size. This approach enabled the entire marketing team to come up with better and more creative solutions to our sales problems."
Consider the following scenario: You're working late one evening and are the last person in the office. You answer an urgent telephone call to your supervisor from a sales rep who's currently meeting with a potential client. The sales rep needs an answer to a question to close the sale. Tomorrow will be too late. You have the expertise to answer the question, but it's beyond your normal level of authority. How do you respond?
This response shows that the candidate is confident in his or her ability and can be counted on in an emergency. Similarly, your answer should indicate that you're not afraid to be the decision maker in a tough situation, even if the situation's beyond your normal level of authority.
"I'd get all the pertinent information, taking well-documented notes. I'd answer the question based on my knowledge and the information provided. I'd leave my supervisor a note and fill him or her in on the details the next morning. I'd be sure to explain my decision, as well as the thought process behind it."
Give me proof of your persuasiveness.
This is a question about leadership, but try not to use an example in which you were the designated leader. If possible, describe a time when you didn't really have authority but instead used your powers of persuasion to get people on your side. Describe your goal and the outcome of your efforts. Why did people trust or believe you?
"During my summer internship I was assigned the task of conducting a benchmarking study for all the communication expenditures for a major utility. I had to get the consensus of employees in several different departments. Unfortunately, they resented the fact that I was just a summer intern, and they refused to cooperate. I had to schedule individual meetings with every employee and persuade each one that I was doing what would be ultimately to his or her own department and to the company. After a frustrating month, I finally got everyone's cooperation, the project went flawlessly, and in the end I received a bonus for my efforts."
What's your most productive or ideal work setting?
The interviewer wants to know the impact that the candidate's working environment has on his or her job performance. How well would you fit the position, physical layout of the department, and attitudes of the particular work group? Emphasize your ability to work in a variety of settings and how you've managed to be productive in less-than-ideal work environments.
"I like having at least one hour of uninterrupted time in the early morning to plan my day. I usually start around 7 a.m. Otherwise, I enjoy an office with open doors, constant feedback, and lots of energy and activity. It helps me work more productively when I sense how busy everyone else is, too."
Do you prefer continuity in structure or frequent change in your daily work?
Your answer should be consistent with the job description. Describe environments that have allowed you to remain interested and learn new things without getting bored.
"I enjoy challenge and change, which is why I frequently ask for the tough assignments. The last two projects we discussed were ones that I asked for. I don't allow myself to get bored."
What environments allow you to be especially effective?
Emphasize your flexibility and your ability to work in many different types of environments. Your answer should not consist of a laundry list of requirements (private office, few interruptions, and so on) or the interviewer may conclude that you will be difficult to satisfy.
"Although I can work effectively in most environments, I prefer environments where people are their own bosses, within reason. I like to have a goal but be able to draw my own map to get there. To accomplish goals, I rely on asking questions and finding people receptive, so cooperation and access are important to me in a work group."
How will you complement this department?
Describe how your personality and/or skills would help round out the department. What types of people enjoy working with you for hours at a time? How would the company's customers or clients react? Assure the interviewer that there will be no surprises about your work personality.
"I enjoy an environment in which people bounce ideas off each other and have the flexibility to ask for help when they need it. I'm usually a great troubleshooter for PC problems in my office, and I'm often going to ask for help proofreading important memos. I believe in give-and-take."
Whom did you choose as your references and why?
The interviewer is looking for a logical mix of people without any obvious omissions. For example, a former sales person would do well to include a former salesperson as a reference. Describe what you'd expect each of your references to say. Include a diverse group-senior to junior, an associate from work, and old professor from college.
"I selected a former boss, a peer, and customer as references, to demonstrate that I'm a pretty well-rounded person and get along with all the important work associates in my life."
Can we call all of your references?
This is a question designed to protect you. If your current job employer doesn't know your looking for a new job (as is most often the case), you can request that the interviewer contact your current employer after you've accepted a position and given your notice to your current employer.
"I'd prefer that you call my current boss only after you've made me a firm offer of employment and I've had a chance to tell her myself that I'm changing jobs. Then, of course, I understand your need to verify that my application was accurate."
Are you most productive working alone or in a group?
The interviewer is looking for someone who can work in an environment without the environment disrupting the candidate's preferred way of getting work done. Be honest but communicate that you're a flexible and reasonably adaptable employee.
"I need some privacy time for planning, but otherwise I like the activity and noise of people around me and the ability to share ideas. I think most writers need reinforcement, because we all get writer's block occasionally."
Tell me about an effective manager, supervisor, or other person in a leading role you've known.
Talk about a supervisor's management style and interpersonal skills. Focus on the positive-how the person worked rather than what type of work he or she did. How was the person able to accomplish so much and get your support?
"The best professor I ever had always reviewed the most important points from our last class before he moved on to new material. He also watched our faces carefully and repeated information whenever he saw a blank stare. Sometimes he would just ask for feedback by saying, 'What are you having difficulty with?'" He never assumed too much or made us feel dumb for not grasping a concept quickly."
What type of people do you work with most effectively?
Focus on the positive here. What type of boss, employee, and colleague would you be? Keep in mind that the interviewer wants to find out how well you would fit in with the other personalities in the company-not how well the other personalities in the company would suit you.
"I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward. It's more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and am decisive."
What things impress you in colleagues?
The recruiter will want to see how developed your interpersonal skills are. More than likely, you'll be interacting not only with your own department, but with other people in the company, and possibly colleagues. Show the recruiter that you will shine in this area.
"I admire and work best with people who are of good character and have integrity. I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment."
How do you organize and plan for major projects?
Give the interviewer a good idea of your general approach to mastering complex tasks. You may wish to include here how you decide time frames, set deadlines, determine priorities, delegate tasks, and decide what to do for yourself.
"I love to brainstorm a best, worst, and most likely scenario. Then I set out a timetable that's realistic. What I usually find is that some combination of my best and worst cases evolves; I can adjust my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react."
What personal characteristics add to your effectiveness?
Talk about what makes your personal style unique and effective. For example, how are you able to get cooperation from others? What specific skills and traits help you get results, and why?
"I always stay in touch with my network. If I see an article that might be of interest to someone I know, I clip it and send it to that person. Then, when I need help and make a phone call to that person, the phone call gets returned promptly."
How have your technical skills been an asset?
Describe how you've used technical skills to solve a problem. Tell a specific story. Demonstrate how these same skills have been useful in other situations or in most of the jobs you've held. If you're hired, what situations will you handle particularly well?
"Although I never planned on a career as a writer or publisher, much of my job in marketing has depended on good writing and creative layout skills. My part-time college job with a newspaper taught me a lot about desktop publishing, how to position something on a page effectively, and how to write short sentences with maximum impact. In all of my marketing jobs, I've been able to explain my goals clearly to graphic designers, which has helped me avoid costly design revisions."
How do you usually go about solving a problem?
The interviewer will want to hear the logic you use to solve problems as well as the outcomes you're able to achieve. Are you decisive? How do you narrow the options and make decisions? What do people say about your reasoning skills? What examples would they cite of your effective decision-making?
"When I need to solve a problem, I generally start by writing down as many ideas as I can think of about possible causes. Next I look for relationships among causes so I can group together symptoms of bigger problems. Usually, after I study these groups of problems, the real cause becomes readily apparent."
How practical or pragmatic are you?
Give the interviewer an example of some practical or sensible approach you've used to solve a problem. When was a simple solution the best solution? Had others overlooked the obvious? In this example, you'll want to show off your commonsense skills rather than your academic skills.
"I can usually pick up on an underlying problem, even if it's not too obvious. I recall an investment banker who visited our real-estate-finance class and asked us what might cause the Tokyo investment community a problem in attracting local investment dollars. A number of finance students in the class started trying to think of some complicated set of reasons. I decided it would have to do with getting out of a bad market quickly, and that a non-liquid investment would create problems. I said investors would be unsettled if the primary investment is local real estate and inflation has caused the paper value to exaggerate the real street value. As it ended up, that was the answer he wanted."
Tell me about a time when there was no rule or precedent to help you attack a problem.
Can you operate without structure? Describe your problem-solving process, especially the steps you took and measures you established in a particularly trying situation. Demonstrate confidence and the willingness to take on more challenges.
"I was the first employee in a newly created position. I spent the first week developing an understanding of the history that had led to creation of the position. Only then did a method for setting priorities on the job become clear."
What's your greatest achievement to date?
Be sure that the achievement you describe here is relevant to the job you're interviewing for. Also, be careful that your answer doesn't sound as if the best is behind you. Mention something great that you've achieved, but clearly communicate your belief that the best is yet to come.
"I'm proud of the fact that I graduated on time with a solid GPA while I played varsity basketball for four years. A lot of women on my team either took a reduced course load or let their grades suffer. I believe the reason I got through it all was sheer determination; I never even let myself visualize anything but finishing on time and with good grades. So I firmly believe, as a professional counselor, in the importance of a positive outlook."
Tell me about something you accomplished that required discipline.
This is your opportunity to discuss a skill you worked to develop, or a time when the quantity of your work required solid time-management skills. How did you remain focused?
"I had to work two jobs to put myself through graduate school. I interned at the newspaper while I studied journalism during the week. Then on weekends, I sold real estate. Juggling those three schedules was a challenge, but I did it because it was important to me to graduate without school loans."
Where do you hope that your career will have progressed to in the next few years?
Avoid the temptation to suggest job titles; this makes you seem unbending and unrealistic, since you don't know how long it might have taken your interviewer to reach certain levels, and you wouldn't want to insult. Describe new experiences or responsibilities you'd like to add that build on the job you're applying for.
"Over the next few years I'd like to have progressed to the point there I have bottom-line budget responsibility, and I'm also in charge of a production unit where I have labor-relations, quality-control, design, and manufacturing responsibilities. I believe this job will go a long way to helping me meet my career goals."
Since this will be your first job, how do you know you'll like the career path?
This can be a difficult question to answer convincingly, unless you've done a little bit of preparation. Discuss, for example, an internship or a conversation that's allowed you to assess the culture of the organization or to preview the work involved. Describe other people in the profession who have been mentors or who have taught you about the field. Also, point out why you're interested, how you learned more about the industry, and how you stay current with industry trends.
"Although it's true that I've never worked a job in your industry, I've talked to many friends and alums at my school who've been successful in your company. I always ask them questions, 'What's the most frustrating thing about your job?' and 'What's the most rewarding thing about your job?' From the information I've gained, I'm confident that I'll be able to adapt quickly to your culture and will find the next few years rewarding, based on my goals and values."
What are your aspirations beyond this job?
Again, don't fall into the trap of specifying job titles. Stick to a natural progression you see as plausible. How should this job grow for the good of the organization? Then turn your attention once again to the job at hand. If you seem too interested in what lies beyond this job, the interviewer will fear that you won't stick around for long.
"Beyond this job as a marketing assistant, I see myself moving up through marketing analysis into brand management and eventually running a category. I'm aware that there are several skills I need to develop in the interval, and I believe with your continuing-education program and my own motivation for self-improvement, I'll have those skills when the opportunities arise for greater responsibility. That's why I'm determined to learn from the ground up, starting as a marketing assistant."
How long do you think you'd continue to grow in this job?
This is a variation on the question, "Where do you want to be in five years?" Be as specific as you can, considering what you know about the position. Don't mention a job title you'd want next, or the interviewer will wonder if you're already preoccupied with moving on.
"My own personal measure of growth in a job is acquiring new skills, new knowledge, and new insights into the industry. As long as I can measure this type of growth, I consider myself successful. I'm a believer in stretching a job by reaching out to learn more about other areas that are peripheral to the job I'm in."
Compare this job to others you're pursuing.
Some consistency or thread of commonality among your other prospects is important here. Your choices must reflect your career aspirations. What common skills are clearly needed in all the jobs you're pursuing?
"I've narrowed my job search to only those large securities firms within the finance industry. The basic skills necessary with all of these firms are similar: strong quantitative and analytical abilities, the ability to make decisions quickly, and good interpersonal skills to react to a customer's needs."
Tell me about your salary expectations.
A well-prepared candidate can effectively turn this question around. Ask first for the company's salary range, then answer in general terms based on your qualifications in relation to the job requirements.
"I've become a little frustrated in the past year because the downturn in our industry has caused limited promotional opportunities. Based upon salary information published by our national association, the market price for someone with my experience and educational background is in the broad range of thirty to forty thousand dollars per year. Although I'm not certain how your salaries compare to the national norms, my feeling is that my value would certainly be in the upper half of this national range. I hope you'll share with me some of your salary ranges relative to the national norms."
What do you reasonably expect to earn within five years?
Again, turn this question around and ask what's typical for the career path. Then consider, based on your skills and performance, the areas you'll excel in. Leave it to the interviewer the appropriate time frames for promotions. Don't speculate, or you'll risk sounding arrogant, unrealistic, or the opposite-too reserved or too tentative.
"My expectation for the next five years is that my contributions will be recognized and appropriately rewarded. I realize that salary levels are based on a number of factors, including the company's profitability and the general business cycle that affects our industry, but I expect to take on greater responsibility each year and to be appropriately compensated for my efforts and contributions."
Other than work, tell me about an activity you've remained interested in over several years.
The interviewer is looking here for a history of commitment over time, and consistency of interests. Do you sustain your hobbies over a period of time, or do you have a different hobby every year? Are your interests compatible with the job you're applying for? Would they be of value in any way to the company?
"I've been involved in Cancer Society fundraising ever since my grandmother died from the disease. In the back of my mind I guess I'm hoping the research can lead to findings in time to save the life of someone else in my family."
What do you enjoy in your spare time?
The interviewer wants evidence that you're well rounded, not just one-dimensional. He or she is looking for shared interests or common ground. You should always, in some way, relate your answer to the job description.
"I really enjoy getting outside-I often go camping and hiking. I've learned a lot about different fabrics that are good for various weather conditions. That's why I'm so interested in your textile operations."
Do you live a balanced lifestyle?
Do you have an outlet, a way to break from work, so that you show up each day refreshed and ready to perform at your highest level? Describe something specific that allows you to relax. Are your personal and career interests compatible in terms of their logic or thought process?
"I make an effort to get out of the office at a reasonable hour twice a week. I go home and walk my dog. That's one of the most relaxing things I do, but it often helps me to think of solutions for problems at work, even though I'm not consciously trying to solve those problems."
What outside activities complement your work interests?
The interviewer is interested to see if the candidate's personality is reflected in both work and outside activities. Your answer to this question will shed light on your personality and thus possibly on your compatibility with the job.
"I've always enjoyed tennis. In many ways it's a game of strategy and pacing. When something isn't working in the first set, you have to change your strategy for the second set. You also have to pace your energy in case you go to a third set, and constantly watch and read your opponent's reactions. I'm a gutsy tennis player-I go for the big points sometimes-but I'm careful with timing. That's the way I work, too."
If you found yourself getting burned out, what would you do to revitalize your energy?
Are you disciplined enough to avoid burnout? When you're not being productive, do you recognize it? What do you do to cope with stress?
"I don't allow myself to get involved in a routine to the point that I get burned out. I've always been the type of person who asks for new assignments so that I stay motivated and interested."
Our company believes that employees should give back time to the community. How do you feel about it?
Describe a time you gave something to a community or organization as a volunteer. Do you go above and beyond what's expected of you? Do you use your skills productively? Are you unselfish-a team player? Demonstrate how your personal interests make you productive even when you aren't being paid. What incentives other than a paycheck inspire you?
"I believe that, too. In my last job as manager I told each of my employees that they could spend one Friday afternoon a month at a charity of their choice on company time as long as they weren't gone on the same Fridays. Ironically, productivity didn't decrease at all; they got more done in the morning-and I guess Friday afternoons weren't that productive to begin with. I've spent my afternoons with an adult reading program."
What community projects that can use your professional skills are particularly interesting to you?
This interviewer wants to know if the candidate will be a good corporate citizen. The question also gives the interviewer a sense of the job seeker's values. Try to focus your answer on productive applications of your work-related skills. Don't get sidetracked describing a cause that doesn't demonstrate job-related skills. Avoid discussing any charity or organization that may be considered controversial.
"As a marketing person, I've offered free advice to our local high school for its fund-raisers, as well as to a local real-estate office whose success could help my rural community's real-estate values."
Describe how a sport or hobby taught you a lesson in teamwork or discipline.
Tell about a time you had to use teamwork to get a desired result. Tell a specific story, then explain how the same skill or lesson has been used in your work.
"My football coach from high school taught me always to watch out for the other guy. If you do, he'll cover you when you need him to. I've applied that principle in all my work groups, especially on the trading floor."
When you aren't at work, do you prefer to stick to a schedule, or do you prefer to be spontaneous? Why?
Be careful that, whichever answer you choose, it's consistent with the job you're interviewing for. For example, since accounting is a profession that requires discipline and precision, your answer should reflect your natural inclination toward agendas, schedules, and precision. However, for a sales job, you'd probably want to show that you're prepared to wing it. This question is essentially about your job personality but is also about your compatibility with the job.
"My workday is very structured because I'm generally in four or five meetings a day. On the weekends, I like to have a plan, but not necessarily a set schedule. That in itself is a relaxing change of pace for me, but I feel I'd be wasting time with no plan at all."
Tell me about an interest that you outgrew.
Describe a former interest or hobby that you no longer pursue, making sure that the interest isn't related in some way to the job you're interviewing for. Talk about why you outgrew the interest and how it's not compatible with your current interests. Be sure to discuss how your current interests are related to your career.
"Early on, I wanted to be a research physician. Then I spent time in a chemistry lab and realized I wasn't looking forward to the next two years of lab work. That's why I've chosen marketing for medical equipment instead. It combines my respect for the medical profession with a job that's more suited to my personality."
What would you do if I told you that I thought you were giving a very poor interview today?
Interviewers like to ask stress questions like these to see how well you hold up under pressure. Your best bet is to stay calm and relaxed; don't allow your confidence to be shaken.
"Well the first thing I'd do is ask you if there was any specific part of the interview that you thought I might have mishandled. After that I'd think back and try to remember if there had been any faulty communication on my part. Then I'd try to review possible problems I had understanding your questions, and I'd ask for clarification if I needed it. Finally, if we had time, I'd try to respond more fully and appropriately to the problem areas you identified for me."
Tell me about your most difficult work or personal experience.
The interviewer will want to know how you hold up under pressure. Describe a situation, either personal or professional, that involved a great deal of conflict and challenge and placed you under an unusual amount of stress. What, specifically, were the problems, and what did you do to resolve them?
"One time my coworker went through rehab for six months after a wreck, and I picked up a lot of additional work to help him out. I know he would've done the same for me, and it's important for me to have that kind of trust along the members of my work group."
If this were your first annual review with our company, what would I be telling you right now?
For this question you obviously want to present a positive impression. "I wish you would show up on time more," is definitely not a good answer. Remember to focus on one or two of your key strengths based on the personal themes you've developed.
"You'd be thanking me for a job well done and would be explaining how you look forward to continuing to see good work from me. Furthermore, I would anticipate your explaining how you really appreciated my putting in extra time on some key projects and how my creative thinking helped come up with some innovative solutions to existing problems."
Give an example of a time when you were asked to accomplish a task but weren't given enough information. How did you resolve this problem?
Although this example may seem trivial, the candidate demonstrates maturity and an ability to approach work conceptually. The interviewer will want to know that you understand that just getting the job done isn't enough. Your response should show resourcefulness and initiative.
"At my last internship, my supervisor, an account executive, asked me to assemble five hundred press kits for a mailing. I wasn't sure in what order the pages and press releases should go, but my supervisor had already left for a client meeting. Afraid of putting the information together in the wrong order, I managed to track down her cell phone number and called her in her car. She explained the order of the materials over the phone, and in the end I managed to prevent a mistake that would have cost hours of work and a delay in the mailing-not to mention a few headaches."
How have you handled criticism of your work?
The interviewer is looking for an indication of the candidate's accountability and professional character. Describe a specific project or work habit that caused you a problem until you faced up to it and overcame it. Alternatively, you might describe a time you responded objectively and professionally to particularly harsh or unreasonable criticism of your work.
"I wasn't able to keep a good employee once who'd been in our manufacturing facility for ten years. His job description was rewritten to require computer skills. I offered to send him to night classes, but he refused the help. I had no option but to replace him. In retrospect if I'd encouraged him and other employees to acquire new training periodically, he might not have been overwhelmed by the time his position was reworked. Now I'm vigilant about encouraging my group to attend seminars and courses to enhance their job skills and to avoid becoming outdated."
Tell me about a situation that frustrated you at work.
This is another question designed to probe the candidate's professional personality. The interviewer will want reassurance that you are able to hold up under pressure. Describe how you've remained diplomatic, objective, or professional in a difficult situation.
"I was frustrated once when one of my clients, who'd insisted on a high-growth stock, called in a panic because the stock price had dropped more than twenty points in one day. I had a hard time convincing him to ride it out rather than cut his losses. This happened despite my attempts from the beginning to explain the short-term volatility of that stock."
Tell me about your least-favorite manager or professor.
Answering this question will be a bit like walking across a loaded minefield, so be aware! Keep in mind that the interviewer doesn't want to learn about your former supervisors; he or she does want to learn about the way you speak about them. Though the interviewer may bait you to make a negative statement about your former employer, doing so can create a host of problems. Even if your claim is completely true and justified, the recruiter may conclude either that you don't get along with other people or that you shift blame to others. The best way around this dilemma is to choose and example that's not too negative, touch upon it briefly, then focus the rest of your answer on what you learned from the experience.
"Well I've been pretty fortunate as far as managers go, and I didn't have any problems with my professors. In my first job out of college I worked with a manager who was pretty inaccessible. If you walked into his office to ask a question, you got the sense that you were bothering him, so we just learned to get help from each other instead. I wouldn't say he was my least-favorite manager, because he was a good manager in a lot of ways, but I would have preferred that he'd made himself more available to us and given us more direction."
Who's the toughest employer you've ever had, and why?
Again, you should avoid making negative statements about your previous employers, at all costs. Turn the question around with a positive, upbeat response, as this candidate does.
"That would be Ms. Henson at Franklin Associates. She'd push people to their limits when things got busy, and she was a stickler for detail. But she was always fair, and she rewarded good, hard work. I'd call her a tough boss, but a good boss."
Time management has become a necessary factor in productivity. Give an example of a time-management skill you've learned and applied at work.
When answering this question, describe a time-management technique you've applied to work that's allowed you to save time and resources. In such areas as public relations time is precious, and the interviewer will want to see that you have an idea of how valuable your time is. Try to give an example that demonstrates how you've managed to increase productivity because of effective time management.
"I regularly use scheduling software, which helps me effectively plan for the day, week, month, or year. It also has a to-do-list feature and an alarm option, which is helpful for meeting timely deadlines. In general, though, I'm very goal oriented and self-disciplined. I like to focus clearly on one project at a time for a set amount of hours. In the past I've found that this has helped me save time, which in turn has given me the opportunity to implement new procedures that have ultimately saved the department time and money."
Would you be willing to locate to another city?
You may, even in some first interviews, be asked questions that seem to elicit a tremendous commitment on your behalf, such as this one. Although such questions may be unfair during an initial job interview, you may well conclude that you have nothing to gain and everything to lose with a negative response. If you're asked such a question unexpectedly during an initial job interview, simply say something like "That's certainly a possibility" or I'm willing to consider that."
Later, if you receive an offer, you can find out the specific work conditions and then decide if you wish to accept the position. Remember, at the job-offer stage you have the most negotiating power, and the employer may be willing to accommodate your needs. If that isn't the case, you might wish to explain that upon reflection, you've decided you can't (for instance) relocate but you'd like to be considered for other positions that might open up in the future.
"I'd prefer to be based here, but it's certainly a possibility I'd be willing to consider."
Would you be able to work extended hours as necessary to perform the job?
Your response should match closely the position you're applying for and should reflect a realistic understanding of work and time required. Ask about seasonality of work, if you're unsure, and show a willingness to work occasional extended hours.
"I'm accustomed to working long hours during the week. I usually work until at least six-thirty, because I get a lot done after the business office closes at five. I can make arrangements to be available on weekends, if necessary, though I do prefer to have at least twenty-four hours' notice."
Sell me this stapler.
With this kind of question the interviewer will want to determine how quickly you can think on your feet, as well as your ability to communicate effectively and succinctly. Be prepared to give a thirty-second speech on the benefits and advantages of virtually any common office object, from a paper clip to a telephone, particularly if you're interviewing for a sales position.
"This is a professional-quality stapler, designed to be functional as well as attractive. It will help you reduce clutter by enabling you to fasten pages together. And since papers relating to the same subject will now be attached, you'll be more efficient and will save time searching for papers. Finally, its sleek shape and back color are coordinated to match the rest of your office furniture."
What is your biggest weakness?
This is a great example of what is known as a negative question. Negative questions are a favorite among interviewers, because they're effective for uncovering problems or weaknesses. The key to answering negative questions is to give them a positive spin. For this particular question your best bet is to admit to a weakness that isn't catastrophic, inconsistent, or currently disruptive to your chosen professional field, and to emphasize how you've overcome or minimized the problem. Whatever you do, don't answer this question with a copout like "I can't think of any," or even worse, "I don't really have any major weaknesses." This kind of a response is likely to eliminate you from contention.
"I admit to being a bit of a perfectionist. I take a great deal of pride in my work and am committed to producing the highest-quality work I can. Sometimes if I'm not careful, thought, I can go a bit overboard. I've learned that it's not always possible or even practical to try and perfect your work-sometimes you have to decide what's important and ignore the rest in order to be productive. It's a question of trade-offs. I also pay a lot of attention to pacing my work, so that I don't get too caught up in perfecting every last detail."
Why weren't your grades better?
It's likely that if you've made it to the interview stage, you fulfill the basic criteria for the position, including the education requirements. The recruiter is probably trying to judge here how well the candidate handles adversity. It's important not to get defensive or to place blame. Instead, try to put a positive spin on the question-for example, by concentrating on what you learned and the extra effort you put in, rather than on the grades you received.
"School was a wonderful experience for me. I really enjoyed learning new ideas, I studied consistently, and I was attentive in class. But I never believed in cramming before the night of an exam just to get a higher grade or staying up all night to finish a term paper. I really believe I learned just as much as many students who went for the grades."
Was there a course that you found particularly challenging?
The interviewer will want to see how well you respond to difficult situations. Demonstrate that you won't fold in the face of difficulty, and that you're willing to put in the extra effort to meet a challenge.
"Initially I was completely overwhelmed by the introductory chemistry course that I took last year. No matter how hard I studied, I seemed to be getting nowhere. I failed the first three quizzes. So I tried a new approach. Instead of just studying by myself, I asked a friend who's a chemistry major to help me with my studies. I also began to seek help from the professor after class. And I found that more time I spent in the lab was critical. I ended up with a B-plus in the course and thought I achieved a solid understanding of the material. More than that, I learned that tackling a new field of study sometimes requires a new approach, not just hard work, and that the help of others can be crucial!
Why didn't you participate more in extracurricular activities?
The interviewer may be worried that if you don't have many outside interests, you may eventually suffer from burnout. Employers like candidates who are well rounded and have interests outside of work. If you didn't participate in formal extracurricular activities in college, you still may want to talk about some of your interests, such as reading or exercising, that you may have a passion for running even if you weren't on the college track team.
"I wanted to give as much effort as possible to my studies. I came from a high school in a very small town, where I received a lot of A's, but this didn't prepare me well for college. So I studied hard. I have, however, found time to explore the city and make new friends, and I do socialize formally on the weekends."

# How to Demonstrate Adaptability on the Job


How to Demonstrate Adaptability on the Job

by Neil Kokemuller, Demand Media Google 

Change and uncertainty can be stressful, but adaptable people exercise patience and flexibility. 

Adaptability is a critical quality that employers seek in early 21st-century employees. With rapid changes in technology, diversity and society, companies need employees who are open to new ideas, flexible enough to work through challenging issues, and generally able to cope when things don't go as planned. Demonstrating adaptability through actions can gain you favor with co-workers and supervisors.

Alternative Solutions
Adaptable people are able to bend when their first suggestion or preferred solution does not go over well. Being adaptable involves preparing backup, alternative options for discussion. Within a work team, presenting multiple ideas and showing acceptance when your primary choice is rejected helps you come across as a team player. In making a sales pitch to a client, conveying alternative product solutions when the first recommendation is rejected can help you get more sales and achieve better results.

Accept Surprises
People who aren't adaptable tend to get stressed and uncomfortable when faced with new, unexpected and urgent projects. To show that you're a team player and adaptable, be willing to take on tasks or projects when urgency is key and the work is important to the organization. While you don't want colleagues to take advantage of your willingness, agreeing to these surprises from others gives you a better chance of finding them agreeable when you need immediate help.

Accept New Roles
In highly evolving, fast-paced industries, company restructures are fairly common, with acquisitions and mergers happening on a regular basis. To show a commitment to your organization, be cooperative and helpful when transitioning into a new or expanded role. This is difficult for many, since change is a common source of stress. However, demonstrating your loyalty and flexibility often helps you get ahead on the promotional ladder. Plus, taking on new roles and responsibilities expands your portfolio of experiences and skills.

Show Calm and Confidence
Your initial reaction to a dilemma or a sudden troubling event provides an immediate perception of your adaptability. To prove adaptability, you want to main poised, calm and ready to make a quick decision when faced with an unexpected challenge. The ability to adapt in this way is especially important for organizational leaders who set the tone for their employees. Adaptable leaders who show a balance of calm and quick flexibility usually pass on those traits to others.

# A Powerful Leadership Lesson From the Sport of Rowing

In this team sport, the advantage of 'free speed' can teach small-business owners a lot about sustained success.

BY LARRY ROBERTSON, FOUNDER, LIGHTHOUSE CONSULTING  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "50%"}

<img width ="360" height= "200" src = "/images/getty_200371449-001_414184.jpg"/>


Leading an entrepreneurial venture is hard, which is precisely why you're always on the lookout for insight that gives you an edge. And there is plenty to be found in the sport of rowing.   

Some lessons are familiar, like `r em("teamwork", "red")`. In rowing, you can't move an eight-person shell if you don't do it together. Then there's adaptability, where, just as in business, no two days or even hours on the water are alike. Wind, water, equipment, and competition can never be fully predicted, so being able to adapt at a moment's notice is vital. But there's another lesson that gives an edge in business as it does in rowing: free speed.  

True free speed in rowing would be having a lighter boat, which requires less energy to move, freeing up energy to gain speed - a real advantage. In contrast, false free speed is the rowers' joke about everyone in the boat needing a haircut, as if the loss of a few grams of hair could provide a similar competitive advantage. The difference seems clear, but it's remarkable how hard-working rowers, just like busy entrepreneurs, allow the lines between true advantage and wishful thinking to blur.  

Here are three ways to ensure you're gaining the advantage of free speed in your business--and not just fooling yourself.  

`r em("Share your knowledge, don't hoard it", "blue")`

It's a fact: the more you know, the better equipped you are to achieve, adapt, innovate, and excel in business. If that's what you want, you can't hoard knowledge. Yet many entrepreneurs do. The rationale they hawk is one of control. In truth, hoarding knowledge is wishful thinking. Rather than speeding you up, inevitably it slows you and your team down. And think about it--if you can't trust your team with the knowledge they need to contribute to your collective success, then far bigger problems are looming on your horizon. Shared knowledge is power, and it's the power you need to speed up the entrepreneurial success you seek.  

`r em("Create a shared purpose, and practice it daily", "blue")`  

While powerful, knowledge is at best misguided speed if those you share it with aren't all rowing in the same direction with a shared sense of purpose. Believing you can state the mission and just move on is effectively the business equivalent of choosing to row in circles, never actually achieving the bigger goals of ongoing success and growth. In contrast, having a shared sense of why you do what you do and linking it to your decisions and actions every single day builds the habit of advantage. The key here is applying shared purpose as a daily filter--something few entrepreneurial teams do, and the main reason why they never tap the power of shared purpose. By working shared purpose into every thought and action in your business, it become a fine-tuning tool that helps you gain advantage. Doing so is simple, cumulatively powerful, and, best of all, free.  

`r em("Empower your team to lead", "blue")`
The greatest example of entrepreneurs mistaking wishful thinking for free speed is their reticence to allow leadership to be shared. Not sharing leadership is the equivalent of sharing knowledge and purpose, and then telling those you share it with not to act. Talk about weighing a business down.

`r em("At the end of the day - and every day - entrepreneurial success is a team sport", "red")`. And you can achieve that success faster, and more often, when everyone is empowered to grab an oar and contribute.

### Rowing Terms
Seating: Seating positions in a racing shell are generally numbered from the bow to the stern in English-speaking countries, unlike many non-English-speaking countries which count from the Stroke forward. Generally the forwardmost rower is called the "Bow" and the aftmost rower the "Stroke", regardless of the number of rowers in the boat, with all other seats simply being numbered. So for instance the crew of an eight (with coxswain) would number off from the bow: "Bow", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Stroke", whereas a four (with or without coxswain) or a quad would number off: "Bow", "Two", "Three", "Stroke".

Bow (bow seat, person in charge): the rower closest to the front.  

Stroke (Seat): The rower closest to the stern of the boat, responsible for the stroke rate and rhythm.  

Starboard (US): the right or starboard side of the boat

Port (US): the left side of the boat.

Stern: The rear section of a shell.

### Commands
"Easy" (or "ease up")(USA): To stop rowing hard.  

"Hold Water"(USA): Emergency stop, also used after the command way enough. It instructs the rowers to square their blades in the water to stop the boat.

"Let it/her run": To stop rowing after a given piece of on the water rowing length, but to put the handles of the oars either to the gunwales or out in front of the rower, in such a manner that the oar paddles are parallel to the water yet not touching it. This allows the boat to glide for a distance leaving no paddle wake in the water. Similar, but not exactly the same is the command "Gunnel", where rowers push the oars until the handle touches the boat's gunwale.  

"Power 10" (or "10 firm" ): The command to take 10 strokes at more than full pressure. Used for passing and gaining water in a race. (sometimes "Power 5", "Power 20", or "Power 30")  

"Hard on port/starboard" (or "port/starboard pressure"): The rowers on that side of the boat must row harder (and the opposite side must row slightly easier) in order to facilitate a sharper turn.

# Leadership from Rowing - Culture and People


<iframe width="360" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2onTdSMBOXY" title="Steve Gladstone on Culture and Leadership" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Jim Millar: Steve, if `r em("culture", "blue")` is a big part of successful teams. how do you try to instill culture in your teams? what's the most difficult part? and what do you do when it's not successful? 

Steve Gladstone: Well I think you know it's the obvious thing. It really comes down to `r em("people", "blue")`. and who are the people that you're supporting for admission? and you want those `r em("people", "blue")` who love the sport deeply. It's not work. they love it, they enjoy it and they have the capacity to work with other `r em("people", "blue")`. I mean the another word that I'd use in this `r em("relationship", "blue")` which seems how would you call it almost flip. it's got to be `r em("fun", "blue")`. and if you now if you look at the energy and that Yale boathouse the over these past five or six years it's wonderful. today is a perfect example of that that way or that element that `r em("culture", "blue")` you know we had five recruits on campus, we interviewed them. or at the end of that 48 hour process we bring them to the armor room and Davenport and we ask them if they have any questions and thoughts and how the weekend was. and to the man. They said they were just really drawn to the spirit of the group. They said during practice the energy how they `r em("bond", "red")` after practice and it's just they're working their `r em("butts off", "blue")` and at the same time there's a lightness to it and a good energy to it how do you bring it about? attract people of that nature and that's what we did. you don't change. when people talk about a change of `r em("culture", "blue")`. it's rare.in my experience. that that `r em("culture", "blue")` has changed without a significant change in in the `r em("people", "blue")`. 

Jim Millar: Steve, Leadership is critical. it's critical on a rowing team. You've been involved in many different universities where I'm sure the selection for captain each year has been different. Any thought you have on the the best selection process? and which has resulted in the best captain selections on a consistent basis?

Steve Gladstone: At most of the places that I've coached, `r em("the captain has played a very very very small role", "red")`. Yale, it's very different and I think that's just a tradition that exists at Yale throughout all their athletic programs. In fact, that subject came up in our first head coaches meeting three days ago. Yes it Yale. it's an important piece. and a good captain, you know, can certainly, how would you call it, expedite or enhance a good `r em("culture", "blue")`. That's for sure and I must say, the last, this is sort of a personal level in the last couple of years, at three years at Yale, it's been extraordinary with Rob Earned, Paul Jaco, and Sholto Carnegie. yeh absolutely exceptional. but basically it's the energy of the group. its individual energy and very often the energy is coming from people that are not, yeh not necessary the captain.

# Real Leadership is Leader Recognizing that They Serve the People They Lead

> _Real Leadership is Leader Recognizing that They Serve the People They Lead._  
> _by Pete Hoekstra_

This quote perfectly describes the character of Beowulf. Beowulf is agood leader because he shows bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people in spite of the dangers hefaces throughout the poem. In the story, Beowulf knew that his people needed a leader and that hewas the only one who could save them.  


Leadership in Beowulf  
To be labeled a good leader, a person must exhibit `r em("bravery", "red")`. At the beginning of the poem, Beowulf and fourteen of his men sailed to Denmark to rid the kingdom of an evil monster named Grendel, a descendant from Cain. Beowulf had heard many stories about how Grendel killed all of King Hrothgars men. Beowulf travels to Denmark because he wants to fight Grendel to test his bravery and to save the kingdom. He knew that he would be the only one in the land with enough courage to battle the enemy. After killing Grendel in the mead hall, Beowulf was honored by hundreds ofpeople in the kingdom for being their brave hero. Beowulf was able to be victorious over Grendel because he did not let his fear of failure stop him from saving the lives of many people (Leadership in Literature)  

Another quality of a good leader is someone who is `r em("honorable", "red")`. An honorable person is someone who is `r em("noble, trustworthy, and ethical", "red")`. Before leaving for his fight with Grendel, Beowulf throws away his sword and armor so the fight would be fair, since Grendel has no idea of the arts of war, or shield or sword play (681-682).  

Beowulf states that he would find no satisfaction in beating Grendel unless the fight was completely fair, which meant he would have to fight the monster bare-handed. Beowulf shows his true character in this scene of the poem because `r em("only the most honorable of men would risk his life", "blue")` so that no person had the greater advantage over the other. Grendel, on the other hand, shows his moral inferiority once he attacks Beowulf and his men in their sleep. Beowulfs honorable heart is rewarded at the end of this battle by being able to defeat his unworthy foe (Brave New World).  

`r em("Loyalty", "red")` is one of the most paramount qualities of a great leader. A good leader must be trustworthy, leaving his/her people without a hint of doubt that they will not be let down. After the tragic death of the young King Heardred, the kingdom was in dire need of a new leader. This was when Beowulf steps in. Not only does Beowulf rule the Geats, but he did so for over fifty years. During his time as king, Beowulf fought in two more treacherous battles, allied with the Danes, and brought the kingdom significant amount of riches. Beowulf was a devoted leader to his people and showed his loyalty to them by `r em("his courageous heart and wise mind", "blue")`. The Danes not only praised Beowulf for being a fearless warrior but also for being the loyal ruler they needed so gravely for their kingdoms sake (Brave New World).  

A leader is someone who serves the people they lead. Beowulf recognized the desperate need for a leader and he knew he was the only one suited for the task at hand. Beowulf makes a good leader because he exhibits great amounts of bravery, honor, and loyalty to his people. Beowulf selflessly risked his life multiple times for the sake of the Geats. Beowulfs exceptional leadership qualities of bravery, honor, and loyalty will be remembered by readers for years and years to come.

Collaborative Planning, Organizing and Coordinating  

Collaborative Planning, Organizing and Coordinating involves shared planning, establishing priorities jointly, and assigning resources accordingly, with sensitivity to the competing demands faced by Aboriginal people. It is expressed by building plans together prior to acting, and ensuring that plans and resourcing align with their evolving interests and needs. It involves timely monitoring, evaluation and work refinement to deliver on the BC Public Service mandate of supporting Aboriginal self-determination. It means developing staff orientation and managing knowledge so that when a new employee takes up a position within an already established relationship, educating the employee does not automatically and continually fall to Aboriginal people.
