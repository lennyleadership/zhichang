**Q: What strategies do you use to motivate a team?**  

The most important thing to remember when answering this question is that you should always have more than one strategy.  

Everyone has different work styles, personalities, and performance levels, meaning how they respond to motivation differs too. In other words, it’s never a one-approach-fits-all when it comes to team drive.

To let the interviewer know you understand this, explain that you always take the time to get to know your team members in order to understand how they work. Then, talk about how you utilise a variation of techniques based on what suits them best.

As always, it’s a good idea to use examples to show how you’ve succeeded at this in the past. Not only will this provide context for the strategies you use, it’ll also prove they actually work.

Right answer: ‘My main strategies are based around recognizing colleagues’ achievements, giving consistent feedback, and providing context for their work – but the ones I utilise most depends on the employee. For example, those who are most goal orientated tend to respond best to understanding the impact of their work, and colleagues that are under-performing are best motivated when given set areas to work on and improve.’ 

Wrong answer: ‘Blackmail seems to work…’
