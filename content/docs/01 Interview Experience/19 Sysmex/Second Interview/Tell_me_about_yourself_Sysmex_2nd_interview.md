## **<font color =#3fb5bd>Tell me about yourself</font>**  
[adaptability] small town, remote area, winter, long drive, customer service at HR Block, new challenges at LifeLabs.  

My field of study in the university and graduate school is chemistry.  I got both bachelor degree and master degree.  After schooling, I once worked at an international chemicals company in China. capital project management and a lab consultant where I **traveled a lot** to manufacturing plants within company and supported QC departments.  I actually enjoy travelling, I read more books than I was at home, I got more things done than I was a home.  Bryce told me, in this job, I donot take trips for overnight quite often, but on the road instead.  When I am on the road, I listened audio books, youtube.  It would be better to install a hifi module on the fleet if it is okay with the company. My wife and I donot have kids, so there is no issue from family.  Then I worked at SGS providing technical support to testing service. In 2004, we immigrated to Canada, I firstly worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs where I was a chemist as well as quality manager.  The owner bought second-hand instruments.  I had opportunity to **do maintenance and troubleshooting** in order to keep the instrument in good shape and save money.  I also **provided technical service** to clients.  The company is located in Northern Ontario. It was a culture shock, weather wise, community wise, language wise.  The hiring manager at AECL asked me: how far away is the Walmart store? It take an hour to go to the nearest Walmart.  In 2009, a job opening came up at AECL in Manitoba.  They hired me in their environmental lab to support a decommissioning project.  I worked there for 7 years.  Due to the union working environment, I monitored the instrument performance, and provided advice.  The technologists took corrective actions.  Pinawa is also a remote area.  1.5 hour driving from Winnipeg, 1500 residents, no traffic lights. I enjoy living there.  The problem there is there are not many jobs.  When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off. Before I landed at LifeLabs, I did customer service at HR Block. self-learned R. started up my own business, and got involved in community voluntary works.  After I returned to the workplace at LifeLabs in British Columbia.  I spent first three months to develop two visualization applications to monitor instrument performance and data quality, one is to monitor instrument parameters, another one is to visualize data trends.  I also developed checklists to identify problems when doing troubleshooting.  I spent last three months at LifeLabs    

As you can see, instrument maintenance and troubleshooting is part of my responsibilities throughout my career.  I have built skills to develop creative approaches to managing maintenance and troubleshooting.
