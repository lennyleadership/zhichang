**Q: are you familiar with like GCMS, ICP-OES, GPC, and TGA?** 

A: in my graduate school, I use TGA and DSC for polymers identifications, and to measure the physical properties. And also the other instrument, but I'm not sure that say if you want to use a recyclable plastic and put it into the mix up with the new polymer materials, then probably you would want it to test the different parameters like the like the intensities and strength, those are physical parameters and property you would if you want to do the recipes of the polymers, probably you have a different instrument and to measure to measure the physical properties and measure other such as the the additives to the parliament's So, I have an experience using those instruments, when I work in the industry, and for the GC and those instruments, I had experience hands on experience in in different lab settings, I use T's GCMS, and the LC MS and even LC triple quard. For the ICP. I use ICP-OES for the elements that metals and elements for the environmental samples. I have the knowledge of the ICP MS. And for the Raman and FTIR. I have the knowledge and it just do you ever get a chance to play with that. So I guess that I need to apply those knowledge to the hands on. 

1) GPC and TGA  
2) GCMS (forgot the provide VOCs test - details)
3) ICP-OES  


**Q: If there is a new instrument or technique that you would look forward to working on or learning more about which one would that be?**

A: I think there's a Roman is on the top right priority, but I'm not quite sure that how would you use GCMS. So and also I know that Nate is core cooperating with other industrial partners such as Dow chemistry. So, so yeah, so I have I have experience with the GC Ms. So so for me that the ramaa is a new instrument I'm quite interested in working on


**Q: Your ICP OES experience.  Is optimizing and working on the ICP, something that you're interested in?**
A: 我跟他们说，我没有操作过ICP。然后，又把话题转到数据分析。我没有很好地抓住重点。  
推演：我没有把在SGS处理不同样品的经历分享给他们。
