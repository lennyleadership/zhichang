EC5.2	Tell us about a time when you determined that there was a need or an opportunity for improvements to the existing safety procedures. (Max 5 Marks)

Probing questions:

•	What was the situation?
•	What needed improvement and why?
•	What recommendations did you use?
•	What was the outcome?

Situation: Concern about paging system in a lab.
A lab door has to be closed, because it is a fire separation door. The voice of paging system from outside was not clear.  
Action and result: I asked to add a speaker.  It was done.
