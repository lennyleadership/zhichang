Q: It is important to be receptive to others’ ideas and opinions. Tell us about a time when you had to elicit comments or feedback from another team member on an important issue?  

Probing Questions:
•	How did you let them know that you were interested in what they had to say?   
•	What questions did you ask?	  
•	In the end did you have a good idea of that person’s ideas about the issue?  
•	What was the end result?

Elicit comments: draw out comments

Revision 2017.01  
Situation #1: There was a time when I returned a report to an analyst, Chantelle, and showed her a couple of errors. I just pointed her the fact.  She commented that I was condescending.  I did not get it, so I asked her 1) why she felt that way.  Judgement, cold. 2) what should I say? “Could you please look into it again?”

situation #2: I found a trending of total beta analysis.  I threw the observation to the team. A senior tech said the detector must be calibrated. Another senior tech said we did not have to, but compare data from two instruments.  
outcome: we calibrated the detector due to the business on another instrument.
