EC.4.1	In team environments we sometimes encounter difficult situations with other team members. Tell me about a time when you felt uncomfortable with a co-worker due to a difference in outlook or perspective. (Max 5 Marks)

Probing Questions:

•	Describe the situation, your role and that of the other person?
•	What was the nature of those differences?
•	What did you do to deal with the situation?
•	How did the situation impact the rest of the team?
•	How did the team deal with the issue?

Notes:
Situation: house-keeping issue. Sample vials have not been disposed.  The instrument analyst, Kent, and I was his mentor for GC/MS.
The expectation is different.
I reminded Kent to clean up the sample vials for a couple of times, but did not work out. Due to the barrier of different unions. I had to get permission from him to clean up the vials.
I asked Kent why you did not do that.  He said he was swamped on other analysis.
Results: 1) One year I raised this concern to the section head.  The house-keeping issue was added to the performance appraisal.
2) Evaluated Kent’s work loads.
