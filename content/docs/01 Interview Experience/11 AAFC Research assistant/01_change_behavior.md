EC1.1	Please give an example of a situation where you changed your behaviour or approach to the circumstances and the people involved. (Max 5 Marks).

Probing Questions:

•	Why did you need to change your approach? 
•	Describe how you changed your approach/behaviour. 
•	How easily did you adapt to the situation? 
•	What was the outcome?

Notes:


Situations: I got a feedback once, I was “a slave driver” in a private business.  I was running a lab business, so commitment to excellence was the goal.  The owner acknowledged my approach.  I put it aside.  

It was two years ago a co-worker at AECL made the same commend to me during a morning break.  I was chasing him for some backlogged reports.  It rang a bell to me.  

Actions: I asked the co-worker what ‘slave driver’ meant. I thought it was a complimentary comment because I am a result-oriented person.  It was not a good phrase.
I took a training course “7 Habits of Highly Effective People”. Aesop's Fables: Goose and golden eggs.

Result: invest to the emotional bank account. Maintain the balance of efficiency and effectiveness.
Adapt to a new paradigm. Mind-set is changed.


补充：我觉得这个问题要考面试人会怎么适应变革、适应新环境。比如，你怎么样适应新工作、新的老板、

How would a peace-maker adapt a new circumstance?
