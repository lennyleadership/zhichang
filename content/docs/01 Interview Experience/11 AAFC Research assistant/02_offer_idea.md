EC2.1	Provide an example of a situation where you offered ideas or suggestions on addressing a situation.  (Max 5 Marks)

Probing Questions

•	What was involved? 
•	Did others request your ideas/suggestions? 
•	Or did you offer them on your own? 
•	How did others react to your ideas/suggestions? 
•	What was the outcome?

Notes:
Situation: 3 years ago, lab analysts generated QC batch ID on a logbook every year. LIMS did not work well. QC officer prepared statistic data out of it. Reduced inefficient work. QC batch generation spreadsheet.

Actions: I took initiative, nobody asked for it.  I did program without telling the group. I spent my spare time without affecting my work.
Brain-storming meeting. They offered feedback to improve the spreadsheet. Protection, audit-trail, time-out.

Results: replaced the logbook. Happiness.
