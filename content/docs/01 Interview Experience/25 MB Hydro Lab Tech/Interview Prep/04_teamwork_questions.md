Task:
To build relationship with him.  
To work together.

Actions:  
1) I did not take such things personally.

2) I got advice from my manager.  Leave him alone.

2) I realized that he and I have one common ground - work ethic.  

3) I improved my competency, helped him to catch errors on reports.

Result: Build trust in relationship, built partnership.
