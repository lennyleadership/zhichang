Company: MB Hydro

Work experience in China, ICP-OES at SGS.

My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  Their customers included municipalities and gold mines.  


I started with the Quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, F1 - F4 with GC/FID, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, conductivity.  During the years with Testmark, I gained experience in every aspect of laboratory operation, routine analysis, quality control and quality assurance, and LIMS.


While I worked at the lab, the community college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  


I accepted a job offer as a chemist in the lab at AECL in 2009. We primarily provided testing for environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.  Parameters include volatile organic compounds, metals, anions, pH, COD, BOD, ammonia, and radioactivity (gross beta).   Due to the unionized environment, I developed and validated GC-MS with headspace for volatile organic compounds. I reviewed all analysis reports. I implemented a balance interface program to transfer weight from balance to computer.  I developed many macro to streamline data processing.  We were able to do multi-tasks without being stressful.  Moreover I was responsible for revising quality manual of our section. Many challenges, and I have not figured out the better way to solve the challenges.


The job at AECL was done in 2016 due to business change.  During the layoff time, I learned R and tools.  I found solutions. While I accepted a job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I quickly implemented tools in practice.  It is a clinical service laboratory.  I conducted troubleshooting of sample preparation for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  I performed experiments from sample preparation, through the instrumentation, and to the data interpretation.


At this position, I will perform routine analysis and provide value-added contribution. [balance interfacing]
