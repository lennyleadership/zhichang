Work experience in China, ICP-OES at SGS.

My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  Their customers included municipalities and gold mines.  

I started with the Quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, F1 - F4 with GC/FID, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, conductivity.  I did instrument maintenance and troubleshooting.  
I gained first-hand quality, operation

While I worked at the lab, the community college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  

I accepted a job offer as a chemist in the lab at AECL in 2009. We primarily provided testing for environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.  Parameters include volatile organic compounds, metals, anions, pH, COD, BOD, ammonia, gross beta.   first task, recommissioned GC-MS with headspace for volatile organic compounds. I oversaw other testing, such as anions and metals. 

I developed macro, I did multi-tasks with easy. work hard and smart.  

unionized environment.

The job at AECL was done in 2016 due to business change.

I accepted a job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021.  It is a clinical service laboratory.  I conducted troubleshooting of sample preparation for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  I performed experiments from sample preparation, through the instrumentation, and to the data interpretation.

During the lay-off time, I advanced my skills in data analysis and data visualization.
