Work experience in China, ICP-OES at SGS.


My wife and I immigrated to Canada in 2004.  We decided to move to Kirkland Lake when a commercial lab offered me a job.  It provided testing for environmental monitoring and compliance with the drinking water Acts.  I started with the Quality officer maintaining the quality system and the lab accreditation.  Afterwards, I performed routine testing, such as anions with ion chromatography, TKN, TP with continuous flow analyzer, F1 (purge and trap), F2 - F4 (Soxhlet extraction) with GC/FID, and E. coli, not to mention COD, BOD, pH, alkalinity, conductivity.  


While I worked at the lab, the community college offered me an instructor position to teach some courses for the water technician diploma program.  I had opportunities to teach what I practiced in lab, and experience of regulatory compliance I gained.  


I accepted a job offer as a chemist in the lab at AECL in 2009. We primarily provided testing for environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.  Parameters include volatile organic compounds, metals, anions, pH, COD, BOD, ammonia, and radioactivity (gross beta).   Due to the unionized environment, I developed and validated GC-MS with headspace for volatile organic compounds. I helped to streamline data processing, implement a balance interface program.  As a result, we were able to do multitasks without being stressful; and we facilitated accurate data with rapid turn-around-time.  


The job at AECL was done in 2016 due to business change.  During the layoff time, I learned R and tools, and I found solutions to effectively monitor quality control. While I accepted a job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I quickly implemented tools in practice. Moreover, I conducted troubleshooting of sample preparation for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  I performed experiments, from sample preparation, through the instrumentation, and to the data interpretation.

It is a clinical service laboratory.


With my experience, I am able to learn new things quickly and fly. and provide value-added contribution. [balance interfacing]
