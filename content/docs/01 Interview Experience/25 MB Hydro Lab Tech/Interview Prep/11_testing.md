## pH

record sample temperature, voltage potential at 7, and either voltage potential (mV) at 10 or voltage potential (mV) at 4 depending the pH range sample falls in.

Slope error(%) could be narrowed, usually \u00B1 5%.  

I monitor pH while checking report.  I asked the technologist for logbook.  Calculate temperature based on slope error and two voltage potential readings.  Slope is a function of temperature.

Check the level of fill in the probe. 

Immerse the probe in the water after rinsing it.

Calibrate temperature probe.
