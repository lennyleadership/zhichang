Q: Describe a situation when you realized that you did not have all the required skills or knowledge to complete a task.  What did you do about it?

A: [LifeLabs]
[Situation] I did not know GC-MS/MS.  

[Actions] I asked the team lead, had leftover of training budget, took on-site training of MassHunter software overview for a couple of hours, I figured out the rest on my own.

[Result] I was proficient in GC-MS/MS.

**Revisit**  
[2023.02.12]  
I could elaborate the result a bit.  
1) I caught a dilution factor error for a compound quantification.  
2) I did routine maintenance, such as clean up the ion source at the mass spectrometer.
3) retrieved EMV value from autotune reports, and plotted monitoring trend.

[AECL Situations]  
Situation #1: learn GC/MS  
Result: developed the method and validated it, and passed CALA PT

Situation #2: learn VBA (specific rounding rules for data and uncertainty)  
Result: **Kill three birds with one stone**  
1) streamlined data processing, 
2) by-product: built trust in relationship, built credibility in team, did multiply tasks.
