## pH

record sample temperature, voltage potential at 7, and either voltage potential (mV) at 10 or voltage potential (mV) at 4 depending the pH range sample falls in.

Slope error(%) could be narrowed, usually &#177;5%.  

I monitor pH while checking report.  I asked the technologist for logbook.  Calculate temperature based on slope error and two voltage potential readings.  Slope is a function of temperature.

Check the level of fill in the probe. 

Immerse the probe in the water after rinsing it.

Calibrate temperature probe.


## Conductivity


## ICP

monitor instrument intensity of blank and one QC level for some elements, such as Al (167.019nm), As(188.980nm), Fe (238.204nm), Yittrium (371.029nm), Zn (213.857nm), 

torch height, 

problem comes from sample introduction

report uncertainty


## Troubleshooting

dry run, air/water check, 


## micro

Total coliform, *E. coli* by membrane filtration on MI agar.

Sterile plastic bottle  

sodium thiosulphate as preservative  

incubator (35 &#177; 0.5&#8451;)

autoclave (121 &#8451;, 15psi)


## Quality control

Use in-house reference material consisting of contaminants previously analyzed and known to contain measurable amounts of contaminants.
