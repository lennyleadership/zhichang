# Introduction

My career has two sections, environmental testing lab and clinical testing lab.

environmental testing lab is accredited. the importance of quality control and quality assurance

drill through the challenge, I am new to LC-MS/MS. I have great motivation to be expert in LC-MS/MS.  I self-learned LC-MS/MS, have passion about R, and its applications.

My experience in method development and validation. in the environmental testing lab settings.

GC/MS

R applications for quality control, dash board, troubleshooting, 

concept of system suitability test (required by USP)



My job at AECL was done in 2016 because our non-RAD section was dissolved.  I went to self-learn R programming language, and figured out many applications in laboratory setting. While I got the job offer as a lab scientist at LifeLabs in 2021, I implemented these applications to monitor quality trends. Moreover, I conducted troubleshooting for the assay of steroid profile in urine.  The job was done due to the supply shortage of enzyme and loss money of the assay.
