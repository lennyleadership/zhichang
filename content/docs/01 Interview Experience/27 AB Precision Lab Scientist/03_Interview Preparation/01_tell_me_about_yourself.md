# Introduction

If I could summarize my career into chapters of a book, I would put my time prior to LifeLabs into the first chapter, my time at LifeLabs into the second chapter, and my time after LifeLabs into the third chapter.  


In the first chapter, you will see a couple of key employers there, Testmark and AECL. Both of labs were accredited and provided testing for environmental monitoring. 

1) I developed the expertise in lab accreditation, quality control and quality assurance

2) I had hands-on experience on GC-MS

3) In addition, I built advanced skills in macro. 



In the second chapter, I worked at LifeLabs.  I have done method troubleshooting and gained:  

1) the experience of SPE,  

2) the experience of deconjugation of steroids, and  

3) the experience in GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS operation  

4) Moreover, I have ability to design experiments

Besides that, I also implemented R applications for quality control and troubleshooting purpose. 


In the third chapter, I kept learning the theory, applications, and troubleshooting about LC-MS/MS by attending webinars, reading articles on websites (such as MSACL (mass spectrometry and advanced in the clinical lab), LC|GC, chromatography vendors), watching YouTube videos, and preparing my blog.


In summary, my strength is the mixed skills in quality, data processing, statistical analysis, and some experience in LC-MS/MS.
