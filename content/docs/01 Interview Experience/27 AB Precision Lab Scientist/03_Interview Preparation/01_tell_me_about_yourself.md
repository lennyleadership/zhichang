# Introduction

If I could summarize my career into chapters of a book, I would put my time prior to LifeLabs into one chapter, my time at LifeLabs and post LifeLabs into another chapter.  


I used to work at Testmark and AECL,  

1) I developed the expertise in lab accreditation, quality control and quality assurance

2) I had hands-on experience on GC-MS

3) In addition, I built advanced skills in macro. 

This is one chapter.


AT LifeLabs, I have done method troubleshooting and gained:  

1) the experience of SPE,  

2) the knowledge and experience of enzymatic hydrolysis, chemical hydrolysis (solvolysis, methanolysis), and  

3) the experience in GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS operation  

4) Moreover, I have ability to design complex experiments

Besides that, I also implemented R applications for quality control and troubleshooting purpose. 


1) After my time at LifeLabs, I kept learning the theory, applications, and troubleshooting about LC-MS/MS by attending webinars, reading articles on websites (such as MSACL (mass spectrometry and advanced in the clinical lab), LC|GC, chromatography vendors), watching YouTube videos, and developing my blog.

2) gain some knowledge of high-resolution LC-MS.

3) read literature

This is another chapter, The key words are LC-MS/MS, GC-MS/MS, design of experiments, and R. 

In summary, my strength is the mixed skills in quality, data processing, statistical analysis, and some experience in LC-MS/MS.
