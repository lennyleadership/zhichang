## How it went?

I was playing pen in hands showing them we are nervous. I also did not say congratulation to the lady chemist who is going to deliver baby.  

**Good impression**  
They were impressive by the business analysis I did at AECL.  


**Presentation**  

I donot know if I made a mistake.  I switched sides with Sheryl Tittlemier. I may tell them I donot have the sense of etiquette, or I am self-centered.  It made easy for me, but not for her.  It may tell them I lack of soft skills.  

The presentation had a good start and a rush end (finished it on time). 

On the way to Winnipeg, I adjusted the focus of my presentation about project management rather than technical details.  That was a good decision.  

I only managed a team for enzymatic hydrolysis part, but not the whole project, therefore, the presentation may not help me.  

They asked:  
Something was on your way, what would you do?  Identify problem.  
What could you do differently looking back?  Web-scrapping  
What is the time line?  No  
How did you keep track of progress?  by experimental reports.  


**Data analysis and VBA**  
It seems to me that my skills in VBA did not impress them.  


**My discernment**  
If they valued my versatile skills in supervision, analytical chemistry, data analysis, programming, and want me to improve their lab productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness, and gave me chance to learn LC-MS/MS, they should hire me.  

There is rare people who knows both analytical chemistry and programming.

I think I would get the position. 1) working experience in federal crown cooperation (AECL); 2) versatile skills more than any other chemists.  


## Questions they asked for digging out from my answers
1) Did you share the performance matrix with technologists?  
2) 


## Technical questions they asked onsite

1) Good lab practices:  
Q: two strategies to prevent errors in analysis.  

2) Sample preparation:  
Q: two scenarios we use calibration standards in solvent is preferable over matrix-matched standard in LC-MS/MS.  

3) choose two out of three scenarios:  
&emsp;a) area of analyte is 139% more  
&emsp;b) area of analyte is 39% less  
&emsp;c) sensitivity decreased over the past weeks

4) choose internal standard for analysis


## The job description
More supervision, data analysis than technology competency


## About them

**The pesticides group**  
EC5 x 1
EC4 x 4

**The mycotoxin group**  
EC4 x 4
Sampler x 1


## Room for improvement
I asked the hiring manager if I could share the electronic troubleshooting logbook to them.  The hiring manager told me to describe it.  I did not prepare for it.  Daisy was right, she told me do not spend time on polishing the website, but spend time on talking about it.  

I did not ask the pregnant chemist the due date or congratulated her.  It seems the hiring manager implied me to move to another quiet room, so that she could get the network problem fixed.  She asked me, but I did not catch it.  

## The drawback of this position
The focus of this position is supervision, not the technical competency.  It is not the primary focus of hands-on experience.  Although I would have chance to learn.    

我觉得我比较张扬，忘乎所以。跟CO-OP的效果一样。
