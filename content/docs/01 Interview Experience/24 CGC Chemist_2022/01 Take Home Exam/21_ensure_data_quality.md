EK1.2 Name and discuss three strategies that you **would** use to ensure quality data are generated during **a 2 year survey of grain** for various chemical contaminants.  Provide a rationale for why you chose these strategies.  (Maximum 500 words.)  [6 marks]

1) Use in-house reference material consisting of contaminants previously analyzed and known to contain measurable amounts of contaminants.
Use blank samples (previously analyzed and found to contain no contaminant(s) above the LLOQ).  

2) Run QC samples in testing batches:  
&emsp;a)	Blank samples (previously analyzed and found to contain no contaminants above the LLOQ),
&emsp;b)	Blank samples pre-extraction fortified with a low concentration of contaminants,
&emsp;c)	Commercially available matrix-certified reference materials,
&emsp;d)	An in-house reference material,
&emsp;e)	Every tenth sample was extracted and analyzed in duplicate,
&emsp;f)	Sample pre-extraction fortified with a low concentration of contaminants,
&emsp;g)	Double blank (50-50 mobile phase A-mobile phase B),
&emsp;h)	Blank (double blank plus internal standards),

3) Monitoring (instrument performance, internal standard response, QC sample response, proactive maintenance, in-house reference materials)
Preventive actions (troubleshooting and document)
