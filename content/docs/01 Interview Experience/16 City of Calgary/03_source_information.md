1. Real-time response  
I went off the topic at the very beginning, then got back to track.  
		 
2. Things can be improved.  
		 
3. Organized response  

When I was Chemist at AECL, I checked the data and authored analysis report.  The analysts provided me with logbooks in which there were raw data and analysis reports.  I paid attention to the raw data because they can interpret the quality of data and instrument performance.  I give you an example of pH measurement.  I took data of temperatures, slope error, voltage potential values at pH 4, 7, or 10.  I calculated the potential gap, slope, and temperature.  I built a database of these raw data, and setup control limits.  I compared calculated temperatures against recorded temperatures on the same day.  I also compared calculated temperatures across different days.  When the calculated temperatures went off significantly, I verified with the voltage potential.  Most of the time, the data told me that we need to look closer to the pH probe or time the pH standards stay on the counter.  

In summary, I used raw data on the logbook to monitor instrument performance.  It is a preventive tool to improve data quality.
