1. Real-time response:  
I had meeting with the manager.  
	 
2. Things to be improved:  
&emsp; 	I did not mention “AECL” where the situation happened.  
&emsp; 	I missed “on a regular basis”  
&emsp; 	I missed “meetings”  
&emsp; 	I said “help the manager to praise analyst.”  
&emsp; 	Lianne at OVRC said:   
&emsp; &emsp; 1) to clarify vague expression, such as “formal meeting”.  
&emsp; &emsp; 2) To explain my role in the meeting.   
	 
3. Organized response:  
	At AECL, the manager usually had a monthly meeting with the section. In the meeting, we covered safety and health, individual reports, quality management (audit, method validation), things to hinder the lab operation from smooth delivery.  I recalled when we had to catch up backlogged samples and analysis, The first action I did was that I took the initiative to host a weekly toolbox meeting. We discussed safety and health implementation, priorities of tasks, workloads, work assignments, time management.  This toolbox meeting fostered team building and team collaboration to accomplish the objectives the branch setup for this fiscal year.  
	 
	The second action I did was that I took the initiative to provide my manager insight of laboratory operation.  The insight covered the workload of each analyst, the time they spent on analysis and training, the situation of sick leaves and day-off.  The insight provided the manager details of the operation, and helped the manager decide on hiring people.  
	 
	The third action I did was that I took the initiative to send a recognition letter to the manager for the performance review at the end of the fiscal year.  In the recognition letter I presented the performance of this analyst in accomplishing analysis.  I praised the analyst for being very productive.  This letter provided unbiased peer review.  
	 
	In all these three actions, my role was a Chemist. I was delegated to review and authored analysis reports. I was not a supervisor, but played as a facilitator/coordinator.  
	 
As a result, I helped to accomplish team goals by building team, recognizing and evaluating team.

key words: At AECL, monthly meeting. Usually we would have to-do list from the formal meeting.  I committed myself to get them done.  
We updated each others during the huddle meeting.
