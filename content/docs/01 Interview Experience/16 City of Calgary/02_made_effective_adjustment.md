Question #13 When you recently made effective adjustment/change to the procedure.  What did you do? Why was it effective?

1. Real-time response  
	An effective change in data processing and data review.  
	 
2. Things to be improved  
		 
3. Organized response  
	a. From a technical aspect.  
	When I worked at AECL as a chemist, I took the initiative to run GC/MS when the analyst went sudden departure. I finished the development and validation of the method. I documented the procedure.  
	I recalled there was a time when the instrument technical service rep came over for preventive maintenance service.  He introduced the SIM mode to scan quantified ions.  Initially I chose full scan mode to scan m/z [mass-to-charge ratio] from (range) to (range).  The benefit of using SIM mode is that I can get more signals on targeted quantified ions within a shorter time.  The outcome is that I got lower detection limits.  I implemented it, and revised the procedure.  
	 
	a. From a technical aspect.  
	When I worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs as a chemist, the IC method was used for analyzing anions in water. The IC method was set to take 30 minutes, and requested a blank run between two samples.  The analysis was not productive.  
	When I took over the responsibility to run IC, I asked the analyst the reason why it took so long.  He explained that the intention was 1) to rinse out the carry-over from the column; 2) to decrease the baseline pressure; 3) to cope with leaking pumps.  
	I believed there was a better way of running this method.  I looked up technical articles and troubleshooting on CDs which the instrument vendor provided.  
	I ended up coming up with a solution.  I connected the analysis column and guard column. I injected water from the analysis column, till guard column.  
	The outcome is: 1) the baseline pressure was decreased; 2) the pump leaks were under control; 3) I cut the running time from 30 min. to 15 min. and there was no carry-over anymore.
