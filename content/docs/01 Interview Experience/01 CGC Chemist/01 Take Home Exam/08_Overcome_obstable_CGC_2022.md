While I investigated three hydrolysis approaches, I encountered a problem cleaning up steroids using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method at LifeLabs.  Some targeted steroids were lost. 

I was recommended using this SPE method which was initially developed for the testing of steroids in serum.  I had to make a new method for my application.

Here is what I did:
-	I consulted with a medical scientist to analyze the problem's root cause and come up with solutions.
-	I reviewed potential variables that could contribute to the losses and ended up shortlisting four SPE sorbents, three washing reagents, and two eluting reagents for experiments.
-	I learned to program the SPE method on the automated SPE station so that I could customize the configuration of each step and optimize the SPE method to meet the experiment requirements.
-	I applied the principles of the Design of Experiments for my experiments.  The experimental data were more meaningful.

I ended up developing a new SPE method that was fit for my case.  My team lead was amazed that I managed to design experiments for a complex project and presented experimental processes and experimental data that was easy to follow.

It was a significant obstacle for me, considering I had no experience with the automated SPE before.  However, I turned it into an achievement. 

This example demonstrates:
1)	my ability to design experiments for complex projects
2)	my versatile skills in data processing, data analysis, and data interpretation
3)	my resilience in overcoming new challenges.
