Key points:

) Interviewers are lazy.  I need to help them connect my experience with solutions to their challenges.  What would contributions be with my experience and skills?  

) Think of that the interviewer and interviewees are on the same side. (Jack K.)

) The employer cares only about THEIR needs, they don't care about YOU. (Jan P.)  

) Write down what they are doing in my words.

) 做到“知己知彼”

) Structures of message: 
  * high level, then low level.  
  * general, then details.

) Structure of "tell me about yourself":  
Option #1: chronological order, from schooling, to each company I worked at.  

Option #2: skill-oriented.

) I was freezing in greeting.

) I didn't work for paycheck.  Satisfaction is my fulfillment.  

) My commitment to success makes me stand out.
