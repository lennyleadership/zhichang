[Record file name: Health_Canada_interview-3, 39:39]  

**DEFINITION**  
Advise and plan based on analysis of issues and trends, and how these link to the responsibilities, capabilities, and potential of the organization.  Scan an ever-changing, complex environment in anticipation of emerging crises and opportunities.  Develop well-informed advice and strategies that are sensitive to the various needs of multiple stakeholders and partners, reflect the strategic direction, and position the organization for success.  

**QUESTIONS**    
Being able to identify and solve problems is an important aspect of being a Chemist II.  You are supporting a team which is being faced with major challenges in a project.  Please think of a time when you identified a problem regarding a program or project and had to **think strategically** to **recommend** a solution.  

The following questions are provided to guide you in your response.  You do not have to answer them individually.  

1) What was the situation?  
2) What was your recommended solution?  
3) How did you manage this situation?  
4) What elements did you take into account?  
5) Generally speaking, how would you handle this type of situation?  

**RESPONSE**  
[Situation: LifeLabs]  
The recovery of SPE is poor.  

[Task]  
to design experiment to solve the problem.  

[Action]   
1) brainstorm with the team of scientists,   
2) manually pipette reagents,  
3) took sample at each control point,  
4) design experiments,  

[Response]  
Optimized the SPE process.  


[2022-03-17 thoughts]  
[Situation]
SPE process optimization  

[Task]  
3 elements (SPE membranes x 4, washing solvents x 3, eluting solvents x 2),   

[Action]  
1) took advice from a scientist,  
2) planed and executed experiments, 
3) 


**REVISIT 2023.02.11**  

[LifeLabs] 
Situation: The recovery of free steroids in the SPE process was bad. 

Actions:
1) Discuss the issue with the scientist team.  
2) Drew a fish-bone diagram listing all factors that could affect the recovery.
3) Designed a series of experiments to test idea.
