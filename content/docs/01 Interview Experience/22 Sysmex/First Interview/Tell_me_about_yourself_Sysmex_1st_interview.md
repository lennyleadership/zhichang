Company: Sysmex

Would you want to know my education and background? start with the most current or from the beginning?  

My field of study in the university is chemistry.  I got both bachelor degree and master degree.  After schooling, I once worked  at a chemicals company as a lab consultant where I **traveled a lot** to manufacturing plants within company and supported QC departments.  I like the feeling on the go, I read more books than I was at home, I got more things done than I was a home. believe it or not.  My wife and I donot have kids, so there is no issue at home now.  Then I worked at SGS providing technical support to testing service. In 2004, we immigrated to Canada, I firstly worked at Accuracy Environmental Labs where I was a chemist as well as quality manager.  The owner bought second-hand instruments,  I had to do my best to **do maintenance and troubleshooting** in order to keep the instrument in good shape and save money.  I also **provided technical service** to clients.  In 2009, a job opening came up at AECL in Manitoba.  They hired me in their environmental lab to support a decommissioning project.  I worked there for 7 years.  Due to the union working environment, I monitored the instrument performance, and provided advice.  The technologists took corrective actions.  When the government contracted out the decommissioning project, the contractor contracted out the testing service, so our lab became redundant, I was laid-off. Before I landed at LifeLabs, I did customer service at HR Block. self-learned R. started up my own business, and got involved in community voluntary works.  After I returned to the workplace at LifeLabs in British Columbia.  I developed two visualization applications to monitor instrument performance and data quality, one is to monitor instrument parameters, another one is to visualize data trends.  I also developed checklists to identify problems when doing troubleshooting.  There are Hematology instruments at LifeLab in BC, but I did not have experience with it.  

As you can see, instrument maintenance and troubleshooting is part of my responsibilities throughout my career.  I have built skills to develop creative approaches to managing maintenance and troubleshooting.  

As a person, 
At AECL, after hours I did rowing in summer, and curling in winter.  

I am looking forward to utilize my skills and experience at Sysmex.
