Gordon Foundation is a charitable organization.  Gordon Foundation initiated DataStream program.  The goal is to share the data.  In order to do that, data must be standardized, verified, to comply with an observation-level data schema (standard) based on WQX standard (It was designed to enable multiple monitoring entities to share results in a common format).

DataStream was first piloted in the Mackenzie Basin with the support and collaboration of the Government of the Northwest Territories.  The collaboration model has been expanded to Atlantic Canada, the Lake Winnipeg Basin and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence region.

There are four Datastream hubs, Atlantic, Greak Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, MacKenzie.  Pacific will be a new hub.

This job will do:  
1) data validation / data quality.  
2) presentation, webinars.
