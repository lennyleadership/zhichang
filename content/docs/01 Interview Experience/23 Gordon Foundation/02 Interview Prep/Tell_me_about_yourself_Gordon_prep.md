I have 14 years of experience in laboratory analysis for drinking water safety and environmental monitoring. The lab analysis included inorganic, organic, microbiological, and radiological characteristics in different environmental matrices, such as surface water, ground water, drinking water, effluent, and soil.  I have experience in different instrumentation. I also reviewed and authorized analysis reports.  As a result, I am good at checking data quality.  It could help me to validate data at the position.  

I love to work with data. I developed visual basic for applications in Excel for data processing, data review, and data uploading at AECL, and developed a Shiny app for quality control and instrument monitoring at LifeLabs.  

I am familiar with data uploading. I created a couple of visual basic for applications in Excel programs to transform our data format to uploadable format. I also got involved in developing an Environmental Data Management System at the early stage at AECL. I can help to streamline data import at the position.    

Overall, I have a passion to work with data and utilize my experience and knowledge in environmental monitoring and environmental science to support DataStream.
