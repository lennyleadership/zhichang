Response:  
It was a great feeling when we accomplished achievement last year.  Last year was the time of external audit.  The external audit is conducted every two years.  It was a primary work to revise the QA manual.  I have been the author, so I led to revise the QA manual this time.  This time was special because the corporate management system department requested to add our laboratory management system into the whole management system.  The QA manual had to incorporate with governing documents and other associated documents in the corporate management system.  
The Management System Specialist and I exchanged comments over the phone and through emails during the revision.  The local QA officers, section head, managers, and corporate QA officers involved in the review process.  I was the contact point to interact each individual ensuring that I got comments back as soon as possible, and the final version can be released and submitted to CALA by the due date.  The due date was the beginning of September last year.  After the first round of review in last August, I realized we had to go for another review, and there was not enough time left.  After consulting with each individual at the different level, it was a necessary to get things down in the first place.  I asked CALA for a couple of week’s extension.  It was granted.  I was very satisfied with the final version.  Through the intensive works in a couple of months, I felt the QA manual was my new-born baby.  I was recognized with the team by receiving the company’s award last year.
