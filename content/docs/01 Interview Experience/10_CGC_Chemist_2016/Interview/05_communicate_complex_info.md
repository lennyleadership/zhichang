Response:  
How I communicate with my intended audience plays a bigger role than what I communicate about.  It is about how the audience process the complex information.    
It is a nature of a technical person to try to communicate the complex information at one time. Although all of information is importance, not everyone could digest all information at one time.  When necessary, I will break the presentation into a couple of sessions.  I will present a couple of key points with supported information in each session.  It is a trick to control the presentation time.  I found the audience can easily lost focus after 45 minutes.   
It is a nature of a technical person to present the complex information as detail as possible.  I incline to share everything to the audience; I tend to have the audience enjoy my works as much I did.  Everything has its value from my perspective.  However, it is a challenge that what information the audience could take away from a presentation.  I have to face this challenge by rethinking about what makes my presentation interesting to the audience. I would present summarized information in a concise way.  Some of assisted tools can be used, such as charts, animated graphs.  Body language is another important component, such as gesture, movement, and tone.  
It is a nature of a technical person to think the audience is as smart as me and believe them can figure out on their own.  The presentation usually is a one-way communication.  However interaction could help me to understand whether the audience is following me.  I would throw questions to the audience during the presentation.
It is a learning curve to master how to present complex information to the audience.  I am learning and practicing such skills in Toastmasters.
