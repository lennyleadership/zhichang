EA1.2 This position will involve managing multiple people and multiple projects.  Describe a situation at work where you demonstrated your ability to manage simultaneous work tasks that had multiple people relying on the outcomes.  (Maximum 500 words.)  [10 marks] 

Please provide the contact information for someone that can corroborate your response.

In your response, describe:
The techniques or tools you used to manage the tasks.  
How you managed expectations of the people relying on the outcomes.
How well the tasks were completed and how you evaluated the quality of the outcomes.
What you would do differently next time.
What you would continue to do next time.
Why you chose this example to demonstrate your competency in planning, organizing, and coordinating.

The situation in the year 2015 at AECL demonstrated my ability to manage simultaneous work tasks and multiple people.  Here were multiple tasks:
1)	Got testing results out.  Many internal clients expected results.
2)	Led the revision of the Quality Manual because I was the author of the previous version.  Stakeholders across the company were involved, including our section, my manager, QA officers at the local facility, QA officers at the branch level, senior QA officers at the cooperate level, and senior managers at the cooperate level.  They expected to review it in the document management system.  The accreditation agency expected it before arranging an audit.
3)	Routine tasks.

I have used these techniques and tools to manage the tasks.
1)	Coordination, engagement, and collaboration.  I collaborated with a primary QA officer at the cooperate level to re-write the Quality Manual.  I leveraged the primary QA officer's influence to engage senior managers to approve the document in the document management system as quickly as possible.  
2)	Plan and teamwork.  Technologists organized and re-allocated workloads to tackle the multiple tasks.  I monitored the progress.  
3)	Improved operational efficiency proactively.  I developed some computer programs in 2013 to process raw data and review data automatically.  It saved my time from reviewing analysis results.
4)	Task organization.  I set priorities for multiple tasks and used the Outlook calendar to manage my time and tasks.

I managed stakeholders' expectations by keeping them updated on progress and unexpected difficulties ahead of time and holding ourselves accountable.

The outcomes:
1)	We met the most expectations of clients for testing.
2)	We submitted the requested documents two weeks late with exemption to the accreditation body.  They executed the audit on schedule.  The external audit went successfully.

Evaluation of the quality of the outcomes:
The section received the company-wide recognition award for successful re-accreditation.  It demonstrated our commitment to maintaining the lab accreditation.

What I would do differently next time:
I could use different ways of engaging others to commit to assignments.  

What I would continue to do next time:
1)	I did not expect to get a company-wide recognition award.  I feel my efforts were recognized, and it was an effective tool to motivate me to do the job.  I will do the same thing to my team in future.
2)	I would continue to improve operational efficiency proactively.

The reason I chose this example:
1)	The project of re-writing the Quality Manual took a lot less time than an average document revision.
2)	I was able to manage multiple tasks and lead the project by planning, organizing, and coordinating stakeholders in different groups at different sites across the company.
