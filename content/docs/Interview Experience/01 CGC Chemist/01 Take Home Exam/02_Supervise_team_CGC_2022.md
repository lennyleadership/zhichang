EC1.2 You are supervising a team of 4 technicians.  One is a brand new hire, one has only been on the team for one year, one has been on the team for 10 years and has been underperforming for the past 2 years, and the remaining technician (on the team for 10 years) is consistently exceeding expectations.  

Describe in detail how you would initiate, support, and monitor the evolution of your team over the next year.  

Provide reasons for your plans and decisions.  (Maximum 500 words.) [10 marks]

Answer: I assume that we have ownership of one GC-MS and two LC-MS/MS.  I also assume the outstanding technician, Brenda, is responsible for two LC-MS/MS, the underperforming technician, Peter, is responsible for one GC-MS.  Both of them are proficient on all instruments.  The one-year-old technician, Susanne, is responsible for sample processing.  Brenda has been Susanne's mentor for a year.  It is time to assign work to Eric, the newly hired technician.
After one year of training on the job, Susanne has demonstrated competence and is ready to learn instrumentation.  I intended to form two work groups: I would put Peter and Susanne in one group having Peter train Susanne on GC/MS, and Brenda and Eric in another group having Brenda mentor Eric on sample processing.
I will discuss the plan with the manager.  I will explain that it is good for Susanne to learn GC/MS as a part of her career plan and help Peter when he could not deliver outcomes; it is good for Peter to have Susanne help him out; it is good for Brenda to mentor just one junior technician; it is good for Eric to be trained under the role model of employee's mentorship.  The plan would be adjusted. 
Once the plan is approved, I will meet with the team, putting my plan on the floor for brainstorming on how to distribute the workload between Susanne and Eric and other details.  I will explain why this plan is beneficial for everyone.  
I will work with Brenda to prepare a plan to mentor Eric during his probation.  Work ethic is a key factor.
Besides regular huddle meetings and routine presence in the lab, I will schedule inspections to evaluate the quality of work as well as safety and health hazard.  I will recognize what they do well and provide constructive feedback with the sandwich feedback method.  Humorous anecdotes could be used in meetings.
I will apply different situational leadership styles to respond to different situations.  If a performance issue arises and the interpersonal relationship is good, I will give them time to figure it out.  If a performance issue arises and the interpersonal relationship is problematic, I will step in right away and help them solve the issue.
There would be a potential risk of performance decline for the group of Peter and Susanne.  I will ask proactively Brenda to support Susanne as a part of the remediation plan.  In the mean time, I will keep working on Peter's issue.
I would suggest meeting with everyone to review performance objectives in the middle of the fiscal year.  I want to keep updated on progress, acknowledge progress and provide support to ensure everyone achieves the objectives at the end of the fiscal year.
Regarding to create environment, I will put a candy basket on my desk.  Instead of candy, I am going to put folded colourful paper slips in it.  I will prepare work-related quotes on the slips.
