Please provide the contact information for someone that can corroborate your response.

We had issues with our LIMS at AECL for a couple of years.  The LIMS was not fully functioning because updates had not been installed.  We can't do that, but the IT group at Chalk River because they had the administrative authority to make changes to the server.  

The LIMS issue was one of my performance objectives for a few years.  <br> I had submitted requests in the action-plan system many times, but I did not get responses, even though I knew the requests were assigned to the responsible front-line managers at the IT group.  The difficulty I encountered were: 1) our service request was not the top priority from the IT perspective; 2) the IT group was under reconstruction.  They had limited resources to help us.

I knew it would be impossible for me to engage the manager of the IT group in our service requests.  I went to seek the support of our manager.  I explained to the manager that we spent about CDN&#36;60k to purchase the software at one point and about CDN&#36;8k every year for service; however, the LIMS was not working properly.  With the understanding of the serious problem, our manager contacted the manager of the IT group right away.  As a result, a delegated IT staff helped us to walk us through the process of installing updates.

This example demonstrated:
1)	I never gave up on facing difficulties and overcoming barriers.
2)	I looked for better ways to engage stakeholders.
