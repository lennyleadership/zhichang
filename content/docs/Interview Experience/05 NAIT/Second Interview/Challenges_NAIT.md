If you were the successful candidate, what do you think some of the challenges you would face? Yeah. What kind of challenges do you think you would face with our group? Or in our group?

my understanding from the newcomers, perspective, is that to understand the dynamic of the team, the first the first priority, is to find out that how everybody is everybody's work together. And then what is the what the what is everybody's strengths? And how do I fit in? And how do I use my skills and put them all together? And to have that synergy going? This is a from the team perspective. And then from technical perspective, I would imagine that there are some new instrument I'm going to use, such as Raman is a crack. I think, the in the first interview, Jeremiah mentioned the instrument for the microplastic, then I'm not I didn't get a chance to ask in the first in first interview, whether I that position need have a time to teach, taking teaching classes, teach courses, so probably that's, um, no. Okay, so. So, yeah, so there's so the, so the, the, the college environment is new to me. So I, so that's, that's kind of the things that's different from my experience in industry. So this, I would say, that's another side of kind of the challenge. Yeah, it's new to me.

1) team dynamics  
2) new instruments  
3) teaching
