**Q: Do you have any experience with method development?**

A:  I have two kinds of scenarios on method development. So one, one kind of scenario is when I worked in AECL, we do the analysis for the volatile organic compound and that is in the environmental samples, and we just follow the standard method. So and also tweaked a little bit based on our what we have of the instrument. So, that is very simple and quick method development that does the process is that open up open a Standard Method and follow the procedures and also there is another protocols that what is what are the parameters, we have to we have to focus on for the massive development and the massive validation, such as precision, precision accuracy, and the bias, and also robot robust, how robustness of the method. So, that very easy simple.

and there's another scenario so, when our work in the Lifelabs, and where that we, we analysis, different steroids profiles in a serum in the urine. And for that applications, there's an there's no existing well made profit method we need to follow. So, so, basically is is do the research and look up the other people's work on the from the literatures and then sort of kind of a figure of the puzzles from here and there and then try here and there and then basically is that we have to prove the concept and the See, which, which is which is a more feasible for the clinical lab settings, because, the Lifelabs is a commercial lab, and so, they want to there is a time frame of the analysis, there is the cost involved in so, so, we have to put all different factors into our consideration how on how we devise a method and and also on the method validation part.  The requirement is different from the routine, other method validation. So, that is the work flow, how I see these method development and validation. 

And the other perspective about about that is from the team perspective, it because in the Lifelabs that I'm quite new, I was quite new to the environment. So, the instruments, the instrument was new. And also sample prep was new to me. And so, it's, it's definitely need teamwork altogether. So, to do some of the, with the lots of brainstorming, and to figure out the problems I encountered, so and also get some guidance from the team lead the how, whether that's my, my experiment makes sense or not. So there's so many trials on the process. So there is another part of for the measure development and validation. Yeah. And then on the instrument side, and then we can we have the so many little experiment that how do we how to optimize it instrument? How do we optimize the sample preparations. Yeah, so that's a very complete so as a very complete, complicated project. Yeah. 

So there's there are two there's two scenarios I all I had experience with. So I'm not sure that see your applications that what kind of what kind there was either the complicated or not so but I my understanding that Jeremiah has developed the sample preparation sample, clashes for the micro plastic and then you are going you're you're about to present to the ASTM Democrat. So yeah, so you have different different methods, development and validation has different have different perspective and definitely needs. Yeah, talent, teamwork, guidance, perseverance.  

Victoria: We also kind of have two ways of doing it where, well, I guess three, because sometimes you just have a method given to you, which is lovely. But a lot of the time, we have a compound, we know in concept how to analyze it. But we have to figure out ourselves, like, using instruments and like you're saying, like research articles, what's the actual process for being able to quantify this material or describe this material using our instruments? And so there's often like, a large segment of time where we're spending, like, like you're saying, like optimizing the method, optimizing the sample preparation, how to read it on the instrument, optimizing the instrument conditions. Yeah. And then sometimes we have experiments where we, it's never been quantified before, like what we're looking at, at least to the best of our knowledge, we can't find any information on, on how to evaluate the things we want to evaluate about a material or a compound. And so we just, we just start somewhere and try to work our way through it until we can get quantifiable data.

**Review**

High level.
three components  
1) Define demand.
2) from Workflow perspective.  
3) from teamwork perspective.

Low level.  
two components.  
1) factors to be taken for consideration: time frame, cost, 
2) approach of designing experiments. one change at a time.
