## Interview Review

**What did I do right?**  
Although they did not ask me anything about Raman, I watched a YouTube video, and wrote down the transcript.  


**What could I improve next time?**  
1) They gave me a short notice on May 20.  I was working on a report of ELA Lake 239.  I only had one day to go through human resource questions.  I think I need one week to prepare an interview.    

2) Write down the sentences for what they have been doing. 

3) I should confirm my strength after they said their challenges are instrumentation and operation.
