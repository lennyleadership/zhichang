This is kind of one of our icebreaker questions, but to just to get a little bit of more of a feel for you. We have an inside running joke in our group about Star Wars. And we were wondering if you could compare your personality and your career to any character in the whole Star Wars universe. Who would it be and why?

Well, I just watched a couple ofthe Star Wars series the movies in the Star War. But I have no idea what which one I most likely be would be. You know, when I was looking at the I wouldn't use another movie SEER series when I look at the AECL, so there was a time when the Christmas time that so the coworkers gave us, everybody that gift. So one gift, the one gift there is with a donkey, and then they put a name on, on the label on the gift. And they the person used the name from the big bang. And so they use Sheldon.
