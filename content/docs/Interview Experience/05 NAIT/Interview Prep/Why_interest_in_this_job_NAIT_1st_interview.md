Q: can you share with us why you were **interested** in applying for this job, as well as the **skills** and **expertise** that you bring into this position?

A: the reason I applied this job is that I have been doing lots of analysis, and experiments in the environmental monitoring and analysis. So I, I've been in Canada for over over 12 years, and most of the most of the times I've I developed method and validate method for those purposes. And then, in 2016, when I was was working at the AECL and the, the company made a decision that to close off the lab, and then it was laid off, then I developed my skills in R. And I was, I was thinking that I would contribute to the environmental science and monitoring using my experience in chemical analysis and R so I always want to find opportunity, then in 20. Year 2020, I had opportunities to observe Aqua hacking, there was a moment that the event that they they invited people to provide efforts and ideas to deal with the challenges. So one of the challenges is microplastics. So and they also use use different kinds of ways. The one of the one of the ways that they caught my attention is that they use data science approaches. So yeah, so that's kind of always kind of my interest, that is to see that how I would I use my skills in analytical chemistry with N, R and R. And then in 2021, I registered at the North America, Lake Management Society, and then I build a network there in the conference, so that I tried to, you know, to expand my network and so that, you know, so I can help help. And then this job, this job came up, I think, yeah, that will be a good fit from for my expertise in analytical chemistry and R and as well as, as well. So my education background, my background in in university is chemistry. And the, this this study in, in graduate school is polymer chemistry. So I have been using deep different instrumentations for polymer characterization. So, so about an hour that's the that's how I see myself that I could contribute, contribute to this to this position.
