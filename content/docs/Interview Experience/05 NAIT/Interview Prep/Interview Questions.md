# First Interview

## Interview Questions Prepared

1) Tell me about yourself
My field of study in university is Chemistry, in graduate school my study is polymer chemistry.  I used gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermalgravimetric Analysis (TGA) to study characterization of polymer materials.  

After graduation, I developed skills and experience in chemical analysis and lab accreditation in Total and SGS in China since year 2000.  

We immigrated to Canada in 2004.  I worked at Testmark environmental labs to provide accredited analysis for environmental monitoring and drinking water quality.  I developed a GC/FID method for petroleum hydrocarbon (4 fractions. F1: C6 - C10, F2: C10 - C16, F3: C16 - C34, F4: C34 - C50) in soil matrix in compliance with CCME.  I was also responsible for quality management and lab operation management.  

At the meantime, I was also a lecturer at Northern College.  

In 2009, I joined in AECL at the lab primarily providing analysis for environmental monitoring.  I developed and validated a headspace-GC/MS method to determine VOCs in aqueous matrix, and oversaw other method development by following the requirement of lab accreditation.  I also developed ad-hoc analysis methods to support decommissioning projects.  Meanwhile, I was responsible for quality management.

In 2016, I was laid off because the business decided shutting down the lab and contracting analysis.  During the lay-off time, I developed skills in R and I always wanted to do something for environmental monitoring and protection with my skills in chemical analysis and R. I did a couple of projects of data exploration and visualization with a couple of lake databases.  

In year 2020, I had an opportunity to observe Aquahacking event.  It was my first time to know microplastics in water is the challenge, and observed some teams to provide solutions using data science approaches.  In 2021, I also registered at North American Lake Management Society as a member, and built network at a conference.  

sensoring, IISD.      

In 2021, I returned to the workplace, and joined in LifeLabs.  At LifeLabs, I was responsible for steroid profiling in urine and serum with GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. I did lots of proof-of-concept experiments. Moreover, I developed a web scraping application to take paper abstracts from a website of National Library of Medicine.

Overall, my broad experience in analytical chemistry, material science, lab quality management, lab operation, data analytics, database, would make me become a subject matter expert in analytical chemistry and enable me to provide technical support and leadership.

education: polymer chemistry.  my thesis was about

### Terminology

Plastics characteristics:   
tensile strength,   
glass transition temperature  

DSC: Differential Scanning Calorimetry.  It is a thermal analysis.

TGA: Thermal Gravimetric Analysis.  It is a method of thermal analysis in which the mass of a sample is measured over time as the temperature changes.   

The test is to determine degradation temperatures, absorbed moisture content of materials, the level of inorganic, organic components, additives, decomposition points and solvent residues.

### My Master Degree thesis

## Questions to be asked
1) Is this position created for Plastic Research in Action (PRIA) project?
2) What are the milestones of this project?  
3) elaborate why this project is high risk?  What are risks?  
4) list of instrument?


## Interview question asked

1) Why you were interested in applying for this job?  The skills and expertise that you bring into this position.  
2) How would you approach developing a new analytical method for the team?  Which resources and tools would you use to help solve the problem?  
3) Could you please tell us about a complex technical or experimental problem you've ever had before?  and What was the issue? How did you solve it?  What, if anything, might you do differently in the future given the chance?  
4) What is your perspective on failure and how do you handle it?  
5) How would you approach the following situations?
