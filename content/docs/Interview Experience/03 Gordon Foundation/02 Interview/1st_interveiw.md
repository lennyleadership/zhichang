## Interview Review

**What did I do well?**
* Prepared and revised "tell me about yourself" as I understand the business more.
* I prepared the question "what skills I could bring to the position?"

**What could I improve next time?**
* Still forget some of components of "tell me about yourself".
* The answer to the question "what skills I could bring to the position?" did not cover "outreach".  There is no hint of "outreach" on the job posting.
* my verbal English is a barrier.
