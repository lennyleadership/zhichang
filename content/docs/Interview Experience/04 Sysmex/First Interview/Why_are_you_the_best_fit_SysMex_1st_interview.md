**<font color =#3fb5bd>Why do you think you are the best fit? / Why should I hire you / why do you want to change career?</font>**  
[It serves as a summary of "tell me about yourself"]  

I would like to thank you again for your time with me for this interview.  

My experience has taught me that most.  Instrumentation and its maintenance and troubleshooting have been part of my responsibilities.  I have built skills and experience that ensure me to learn new instrumentation quickly and solve computer program related issues.  I also believed most of service calls are associated with application.  

Moreover, I enjoy in troubleshooting, I would not mind taking extra efforts to serve clients. If I got service calls during the week-end or evening, I would answer the calls and spend time to find solutions. I would have ideas for better maintenance management.  

I also *<font color ="blue">enjoy travelling</font>*.

As a person, I am a friendly and pleasant person to work with.

**Overall**, with my qualification as well as my personality, I believe that would make me a very solid candidate for this position.
