**<font color =#3fb5bd>What did you do at LifeLabs?</font>**  
I was hired at LifeLabs as a lab scientist.  I was in responsible for steroid profiling in urine, which included quality control, troubleshooting on analysis and instruments, and method development.  

I developed two applications to monitor the instrument (GC-MS/MS detector, and lab test data, such as sample data, and QC data).
