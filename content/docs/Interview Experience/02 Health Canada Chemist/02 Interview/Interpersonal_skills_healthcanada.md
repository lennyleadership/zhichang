**QUESTIONS**  
We must often work as a team to get a task done and sometimes the members of that team differ from us in temperament or in the way they work.  Tell us about a recent experience in which you were part of team and had **to adapt to working with someone** despite your differences.  

1) What was the other person like and what was your relationship with that person?  
2) What situation did you have to adapt to?  
3) What did you do to adapt?  
4) Did the team accomplish its task?
