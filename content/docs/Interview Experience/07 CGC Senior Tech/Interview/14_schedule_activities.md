Q: 14.  Describe a situation in which you had to schedule your activities to meet a work objective.  


**Revisit 2022.08.02**

[Situation] LifeLabs  
investigate chemical hydrolysis approach.   

The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined LifeLabs. I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes. The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers. All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.

The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable. What did we do? A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps. Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis. I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step. Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol.

We did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further. It was the risk.

My team lead and I decided to take a chance. I read through lots of literature, designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis with solvolysis, and methanolysis, set up instrument configurations, and ran experiments. To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late to work around the medical lab technologists’ schedule using the automated SPE station.

I managed to finish the project within two months. The project proved that the solvolysis approach was the best way to cleave steroid conjugates.

This example demonstrated:
