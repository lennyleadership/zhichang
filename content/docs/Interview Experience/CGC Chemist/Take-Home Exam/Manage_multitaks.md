# EA 1.2 Manage Simultaneous Work Tasks


Q: This position will involve managing multiple people and multiple projects.  Describe a situation at work where you demonstrated your ability to manage simultaneous work tasks that had multiple people relying on the outcomes. (Maximum 500 words.)

Please provide the contact information for someone that can corroborate your response.

In your response, describe:  
The techniques or tools you used to manage the tasks.  
How you managed expectations of the people relying on the outcomes.  
How well the tasks were completed and how you evaluated the quality of the outcomes.  
What you would do differently next time.  
What you would continue to do next time.  
Why you chose this example to demonstrate your competency in planning, organizing, and coordinating.  

Imagine a busy day when technologists gave you a pile of draft analysis reports on the desk for review, and at the same time, you were working on a document.  Both of them were the top priority.  That was the situation I was in in the year 2015 at AECL.  

However, I had to get your attention back a few years before that.  People often get used to doing urgent and important things, like a firefighter.  I was like that until I took the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” course.  It helped me to transform the mindset of what things I could put my efforts on as top priorities.   

I decided to tackle the bottleneck of data processing and report review.  As you know, it is tedious and repetitive to process data.  We also implemented situationally-based rules to round uncertainty at AECL and reported them with results.  It could be problematic due to human error.  As a result, it is time-consuming for the person who reviews data.  After hours, I worked on the programs with the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Excel, which automated the data processing and manipulation.  The solution was implemented in the year 2013.  

Time returned to the year 2015.  It was the year we expected an upcoming external audit in the fall on top of routine tasks.   Besides regular document review, we decided to rewrite the Quality Manual and submit it to the accreditation agency.  When technologists gave me a pile of draft reports, I set aside the document I was working on and reviewed them with running the programs.  I either signed them or returned them for correction.  I managed to complete it within a couple of minutes per each report.  I then continued working on the document.  The Quality Manual was submitted to the accreditation agency at the last minute.  Without the programs, the data quality could suffer, or I would take extra time to prepare the document and review the data.  I used VBA and R to improve efficiency and productivity at LifeLabs.  I would continue to do that next time.  

That does not mean I overlooked other techniques and tools to manage the tasks.  I used Outlook to manage and prioritize tasks.  When overwhelming, I discussed the task priority with my manager in the weekly meeting and redistributed tasks on my plate if needed.  I did not delegate my work because I did not have the authority.  I could do that next time.
Moreover, I initiated weekly huddle meetings within the section to address operational concerns on multitasks or multiple projects.  

Overall, I am good at planning and taking proactive actions to work smart and efficiently on multiple tasks.
