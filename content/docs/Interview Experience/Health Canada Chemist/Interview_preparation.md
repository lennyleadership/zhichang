    <td><p>Case #01 [AECL] in 2015, when I was working with AECL as a Chemist.  There were problems with the laboratory information management system (LIMS).  We did not get the LIMS updated that year. I talked with my manager about reasons. Firstly, it slowed down data processing. Secondly, we paid annual service fee without getting benefit.  Meanwhile, I leveraged the retired manager’s power to persuade the manager.  I suggested having my manager seeking support from the IT manager at the corporate level.  Finally, the LIMS issue became a top priority for the manager, and we got the LIMS updated.

## Optional Question


### first draft
I am gra*`r em("T", "red")`*eful for being invited for this first-step interview.

There is one objective in the branch strategi*`r em("C", "red")`* plan 2019-2022 caught my attention.  It says this, "to become more proactive by leveraging data to better identify and manage risk*`r em("S", "red")`*" and one key initiative says this, "to provide **timely** analysis and information to law enforcemen*`r em("T", "red")`* partner*`r em("S", "red")`* and client*`r em("S", "red")`*."  

I would like to highlight two things about me here.

Firstly, as a saying goes, "Begin with the end in mind". My understanding is this: the leveraging of data starts with good quality of data. Great sampling uncertainty and measurement uncertainty leads to wrong interpretation and wrong conclusion.  My comprehensive experience in delivering accredited analysis and maintaining quality management system can contribute to the data quality.

Secondly, with computer programming skills, I had experience in automating data population process, analyzing various forms of  data from lab test and research experiments.  As a result, I reduced human errors, saved time, guaranteed data quality, provided timely analysis, and created insights.  My team lead at LifeLabs complimented that "your ability to effectively present data was far better than mine or most people’s".  I feel I could be part of solution to leverage data.   

My superiors complimented that I committed to team success. I am grateful that they see me as dedicated to work, trustworthy, a man of integrity, and a friendly and pleasant person to work with.

Thanks again for your time.

## Review of the interview

What did I do right?  
1. I collected the competency dictionaries online, and outlined case answer.  
2. I wrote down the answers, spoke out (自言自语).  It helped me to structure information, and organize the thoughts.  
3. 

What could I do better next time?
1. Daisy commented that I did not do my best.  She said I would recite the answer without any blank space in answer, the answers must be flowing smoothly.

2. Realized that I need to practice how I describe a process.  I did not explain well enough how I optimize SPE method.  I did not do well in BV interview when they wanted to talk about bile acid method development, because I did not prepare for it.
