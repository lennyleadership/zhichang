**Q: Received a call after hours, UV light bulb broke.  Everyone went for the day and contract lab is closed.  What do you do?**  

This question checks if I know of the process.

[background]: why did I receive the call?

I will get hold of the manager-on-call. 

Contract lab is closed, could not take sample(s) and do analysis.

use alternative process?
