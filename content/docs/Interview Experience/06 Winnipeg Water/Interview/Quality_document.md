**Q: Why is important to clear the process formal documentation for quality control?**

First of all, we need to write a good document.  It is not a documentation for audit. We prepare one, but leave it on the shelf.  It is only the good document that becomes important.  

1) The good document should be comprehensive, It includes test-associated information as much as possible so that everyone does not need to go elsewhere, for example, method validation results could be attached to the procedure as an appendix.  I call it as a one-stop shop. 

2) The procedure is easy to follow.

The purpose of formal document is to share knowledge, experience, 

The importance.
1) Be consistent among different analyst.  It is a way of control quality.  
2) Used as a training material.  

The procedure must be followed.
