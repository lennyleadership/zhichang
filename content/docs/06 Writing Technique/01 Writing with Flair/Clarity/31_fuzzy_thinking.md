Now, one of the main things that stands in the way of clarity in your writing is, quite simply, fuzzy thinking.

By fuzzy thinking, I mean you aren't really clear or sure about what it is that you're trying to say.

And when you're not really clear about the idea you're trying to get across, and then you leave a fuzzy idea in your writing, it's likely going to take, it's likely going to muddy up and cloud everything else that follows.

And the trouble is that sometimes an idea doesn't fall onto your page with perfect clarity.

In that case, you have to polish the idea up and make sure it's as clear as it can be before you publish or submit whatever it is that you've written.

Now, we've already seen the many things that you can do to simplify your ideas.

And later, we're going to learn about how to add the other two ingredients to your writing, <u>elegance and evocativeness</u>, to make it even stronger and even prettier.

But I want you to understand that before you can do any of those things effectively you've got to make sure that your ideas themselves make perfect sense, and that they're meaningful and clear to begin with.

In other words, clarity must come first.

Otherwise, as I've said you'll merely be trying to put lipstick on a pig, hoping that somehow it's going to look pretty.

So, once you've got your ideas down on paper, you've normally got to play around with the structure of them, or you know with the wording of them, until you hit that moment of clarity where you can say that this is now a very clear and a very meaningful point.

Now, that's especially true of the very first thing that you say in a piece of writing, because if the very first thing you say isn't clear, you've pretty much lost the reader.

Let's say you started reading a blog post and the opening sentence was this...

<img width ="360" height= "200" src = "/docs/images/Screenshot 2022-09-26 112704.png" style ="float: left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>

Now, I don't know about you, but that sentence doesn't really click for me.

Did you find yourself struggling to extract meaning from it?

And if so, you're likely dealing with a fuzzy idea.

Now, pause and think about why that fuzziness is happening.

That's right.

There's a lack of clarity about various things, like <u>whose quest for greatness</u>, and <u>what kind of greatness</u>? Things, things like that.

If you ever write a sentence like this, the first thing you want to do is figure out, what am I really trying to say here?

Don't leave it there, hoping that your readers will somehow manage to figure it out, because they probably won't bother.

And why should they?

Now, before we can even get into making the sentence more <b>simple, elegant and evocative</b>, we have to know what it's basically trying to to say, alright?

So I want to give you a bit more of the blog post to help you figure out what the author's intent is with that sentence.  
<br>  
<img width ="360" height= "200" src = "/docs/images/Screenshot 2022-09-26 113304.png" style ="float: left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>

>*<b>"In the continuing quest for greatness, remember that a lot can be learned from people whose startups have crashed. They might, in fact, be the best people to consult with if your business is stuck in a hole - as their tragic tales may help you to avert a foreseeable catastrophe. I understand that for budding entrepreneurs, like yourself, it's natural to yearn for the countless success stories in the world of business. A new study, however, suggests it may be more instructive to go and grab a beer with some entrepreneurial losers."</b>*

Now, those subsequent sentences are clear enough, I think, and they suggest that this might otherwise be, you know, a pretty engaging piece.

But we've still we still got that first sentence that hurts a bit to read, because it's fuzzy, it's lacking in sharpness, the sharpness of the rest of it. And maybe you notice that the problem is really that the two ideas in that first sentence, well, they don't really link up too well, do they? "In the continuing quest for greatness, remember that a lot can be learned from people whose startups have crashed." And the problem really seems to be, you know, in the first half of that sentence... "In the continuing quest for greatness...."

Now, if you look at that it's not very precise, is it? It's vague, it's fuzzy, it's abstract.

As I said, whose quest for greatness? You know, the author hasn't really pinned down the idea well enough to make it click with the reader.

So let's have a think.

How could we make that idea a little bit less fuzzy?

So, pause this, and use the other information that's there to create a first half of the sentence that links up well with the second half.

Okay, how did it go?

Here's something I came up with based on the rest of the information that's provided in the post.

>As you battle to turn your company into a raging success, remember that a lot can be learned from people whose startups have crashed. They might, in fact, be the best people to consult with if your business is stuck in a hole, as their tragic tales may help you to avert a foreseeable catastrophe. I understand that for budding entrepreneurs, like yourself, is natural to yearn for the countless success stories in the world of business. A new study, however, suggests it may be more instructive to go and grab a beer with some entrepreneurial losers.

See how, in a pretty simple way, you can turn that fuzzy sentence into something that just clicks, it just sounds you know jazzier now, doesn't it?

Don't you feel we've achieved a better linkup of the two ideas there than in the original version?

So, I hope you got something similar, or hopefully even better than that.
