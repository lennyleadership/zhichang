In the simplicity section, you learned a bunch of tactics to help you write in a concise, no-nonsense and non-cluttery way.

That was the first step toward becoming an exceptional writer.

Learning all about simplicity.

You saw how writing in a simple way helps readers to get your message with the least amount of friction, obstruction, or resistance. That, if you like, was the beauty of simplicity that I was talking about.

Now, in this section I'm going to introduce you to a second ingredient in the secret sauce, and that ingredient is clarity, and I will reveal to you the beauty of writing in a clear and a focused way.

Now, I want you to understand that clarity is arguably the most fundamental of <u>the four ingredients</u> that I'm teaching you, because unless your ideas are clear, there is really little point in trying to enhance them in other ways.

Imagine you've written down a sentence that's not entirely clear.

Now, if you start trying to dress the idea up by making it more punchy, more graceful and more stimulating, what's the point if the meaning remains unclear?

In other words, you can get away with not having any other ingredient in your writing, but if your writing isn't clear to begin with, the other ingredients are virtually going to be useless.

So, we really need to understand the concept of clarity very, very well. Now, fundamentally, clarity is about ensuring that your ideas and points convey your intended meaning as effectively and as crisply as possible.

And there are a ton of things that stand in the way of that. Now, to put it into context:

simplicity was all about removing the heaviness and the slowness in your writing, which to be sure also stands in the way of easy comprehension. But clarity is about making sure your meaning gets across beautifully to your readers.

It's about making sure they understand completely what you're saying without having to question anything in your writing.

It's about making sure no one gets baffled by your argument.

For example, making sure that their minds, the readers' minds, never go blank while reading your work. Making sure that they aren't confused at any time by the terminology that you are using.

Clarity is about pinning down your message so firmly and so precisely that there can be no doubt whatsoever about your message.

Now, on top of that it's about making your writing so crisp and sharp that not only do people understand what you're saying, they'll understand it pretty much instantly. So, take a firm decision now never to be lazy when it comes to writing.

Never leave the reader to do the work of figuring out what you're trying to say. Rather, every point you make in your writing has to be unambiguously clear and well-defined.

As an elite writer, you must be conscientious enough, willing enough, dedicated enough to ensure that what you're saying is always distinctive and always meaningful.

You stand by the principle that if a reader doesn't understand what you're saying, it's your fault. It's not their fault.

You haven't composed or expressed your idea well enough, that's all. Sensing that the meaning of a sentence may not be coming through clearly enough, you rearrange words and ideas in whatever way you need to in order to get your meaning across brilliantly.

This scale of effort in the realm of clarity is absolutely vital to creating exceptional writing.

So I want you to take this concept of clarity very much to heart.
