## Horse
In a rural area a farmer was tending to his horse named Buddy, and along came a stranger who despartely needed the farmer's help. The stranger had lost control of his vehicle and ran it off into a ditch. The stranger asked the farmer if his horse could somehow pull the vehicle out of the ditch for him and told the farmer that the vehicle was small. The farmer said he would come, bring his horse, and take a look, but could not promise he could help if his horse might be injured in some way from attempting to pull the vehicle out of the ditch. The farmer did see that the stranger was correct and that the vehicle was small, so the farmer took a rope and fixed it so that his horse, Buddy, would be able to pull the vehicle out of the ditch. The farmer then said, "Pull, Casey, Pull," but the horse would not <u>budge</u>. The farmer then said, "Pull, Bailey, Pull," but the horse would not <u>budge</u> again. The farmer then said, "Pull, Mandy, Pull," and again the horse would not <u>move</u>. The farmer then said, "Pull, Buddy, Pull," and the horse pulled until the vehicle was out of the ditch. The stranger was so very grateful, but asked the farmer why he called the horse by different names? The farmer said, "Buddy is blind, and I had to make him think he had help pulling the car out of the ditch or he would not have pulled."

**Lesson**: Don't wait on others in order to accomplish something or you may always be in a ditch. Sometimes we won't attempt to do something if we know we don't have help.

## Father and Son
A child and his father were visiting an elderly neighbor. They were raking the neighbor's leaves, organizing the neighbor's garage, putting the trash out, and performing other small jobs around the neighbor's house. The child had not really seen the elderly neighbor up close, but on this day the child was going to meet the neighbor up close for the first time. When the child met the neighbor up close he asked the neighbor how old he was, and the father was flabbergasted by his child's question and attempted to apologize to the neighbor, but the neighbor laughed and said that was ok, the child is curious. The elderly neighbor told the child he was 92 years old. The child had a look of unbelief and asked the neighbor, "Did you start at the number one?"

**Lesson**: Actually, everybody starts before the number one.
