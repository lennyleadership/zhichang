A rejection is not easy to take if you take it personally, and it does feel personal. However, many factors go into the final decision. Some of them have nothing to do with you, but with circumstances. For example, someone from within the company got recommended for the same position by a manager from another department. Since that person already knows about the company and its culture and modus operandi, it may save the hiring manager time and cost in getting the internal candidate onboard and getting productive than hiring someone from outside. Or the company faced some budget issues and rescinded the job requisition.  

An excellent way to take rejection is to understand that it is a numbers game, and odds usually are higher for rejection than acceptance. In sales training, the reps learn that of the100 leads that one gets, the chances of actually closing a sale are probably 3 or 4%. It is the same with direct mail. So each rejection has less to do with a sales rep’s skill alone, and more with the buyer’s circumstances and readiness to actual readiness to buy. The same is true of any situation where competition exists.  

The important part is never to stop trying. Many successful actors suffered rejections in auditions, but they would never have made it if they stopped. All one needs is just one break to prove their talent and skill.  

Don’t build an unrealistic expectation, just go with an attitude that even with your best interview, there is a 50% chance that you will get the job, but also a 50% chance that you may not. The higher the number of applicants, the heavier the odds against a positive outcome. BUT as they say in the lottery commercials, “ You have to be in it, to win it.”. You just have to give it your best shot.
