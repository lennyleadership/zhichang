The Indeed Editorial Team comprises a diverse and talented team of writers, researchers and subject matter experts equipped with Indeed's data and insights to deliver useful tips to help guide your career journey.

Employers commonly ask interview questions that challenge candidates to discuss their professional experiences with tact and self-awareness. For instance, an employer might ask you to describe an instance in which you worked with a difficult coworker to assess your personality and ability to work as a part of a team. If you're preparing for an interview, it may be helpful for you to learn more about this common question and how you can answer it effectively.

In this article, we explain why employers ask questions about working with difficult people and the steps to take to form a thoughtful response, plus we offer two example answers to reference when crafting your own.

## Why do employers ask questions about working with difficult people?

Employers may ask you to tell them about a time you worked with difficult people to make a [behavioral assessment](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/behavioral-assessment) regarding how well you work alongside others and what strategies you use to handle conflict at work. Your answer to this question may allow an employer to glean insight into your personality, perspective and approach as a professional. From here, employers may be able to better evaluate whether you're a good fit for an organization and its workplace culture.

## How to answer "Tell me about a time you worked with difficult people"

[Answering this question can be a challenging task](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/tough-interview-questions-and-answers), as it requires you to avoid speaking negatively about your colleagues while explaining a difficult situation you encountered. With this, though, there are a few steps you can take to ensure you form an effective response:

### 1. Consider an instance in which you experienced a specific challenge with a coworker

When choosing an instance to discuss, try to identify one in which you experienced a specific challenge. It's important to avoid discussing a previous coworker's negative personality traits or lack of professionalism. Instead, focus on [issues you've encountered with a colleague](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/how-to-deal-with-difficult-coworker)'s particular actions that impacted your work.

### 2. Speak objectively while explaining the premise of the situation

As you begin to describe the premise of the situation, try to maintain objectivity. To do this, overcome the impulse to discuss how the experience made you feel and instead concentrate on the tangible impact of your coworker's behavior. Speaking [objectively](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/objective-vs-subjective) can help demonstrate your ability to approach work issues without investing in them emotionally.

### 3. Reflect on the experience and take ownership of your own actions

While discussing the situation, reflect on the experience and try to be [accountable](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/accountable-vs-responsible) for your own actions. Consider whether there is something you might have been able to do to avoid the conflict you experienced. Discussing this perspective of the situation can show employers that you're capable of taking ownership of your behavior as a professional.

### 4. Detail how you resolved the situation and what you learned from it

As you finish your response, describe how you [resolved the situation](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/conflict-resolution-skills). Detail the specific actions you took to overcome the challenge you faced and mend your relationship with your colleague. From here, end your answer by discussing what you learned from this experience and how you've grown from it.

## "Tell me about a time you worked with difficult people" example answers

You may be able to answer this question more successfully after reviewing sample responses and using them as a guide in forming your own. Here are two example answers about working with difficult people from both an entry-level and experienced perspective:

### As an experienced candidate

Seasoned candidates may have various experiences to draw from when answering this question in an interview. With each of these experiences in mind, try to choose an instance you can discuss that demonstrates your work ethic, leadership skills and ability to be patient with others.

Example: "In my previous role as the director of student support and wellness, we had an automated system through which students made reports about their mental health or other issues that needed attention. I relied on these reports to know what students were struggling, so I could contact them and help them find the services they needed. Unfortunately, my coworker who processed these reports frequently fell behind in her duties and caused a delay in many of our interventions with students, which was a major problem due to the emergent nature of some situations we dealt with.

While my coworker acknowledged her inefficiency, I realized she may not have truly understood the impact of the delay on our entire team's workflow. I asked her to lunch one day and explained the situation from my perspective. My coworker explained her processing duties were becoming overwhelming and could better meet expectations if she split her responsibilities with another colleague. We tried this system out, and thankfully the issue resolved itself within the following two weeks. This experience taught me that I can work through any problem alongside my coworkers—no matter how seemingly insurmountable it is—with patience and collaborative effort."

### As an entry-level candidate

Entry-level candidates may have fewer experiences to speak about when answering this question. With a limited number of experiences to draw from, you may benefit from focusing your answer on an instance in which you faced an issue with your coworker and navigated it successfully by seeking mentorship from a supervisor or manager.

Example: "I participated in a fellowship program over the summer as a part of my studies. Through the program, I was able to conduct a research project of my own using university resources, like the library's special collections archive, to support my work. I worked alongside three other fellows who were taking part in the program and conducting their own projects. We collaborated while forming our research questions, and one of my coworkers was particularly negative about my approach to my project. I wanted to understand her concerns, so I asked her about them in one of our collaborative meetings.

Unfortunately, she avoided my question. Afterward, I spoke with my research mentor and asked for her guidance. My mentor advised me to speak with my coworker privately, so I invited her to get coffee with me later that day. During our conversation, I asked for her feedback about my project. I realized she was planning on using the same archive as me to support her research and had concerns regarding the availability of the space and resources. I reassured her that she would have access as well, and together we created a schedule that worked for the both of us."
