**Q: Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult employee**  

Difficult people are an inevitable part of life – and as a manager, your ability to deal with them in the right way is extra important.  

You’d be surprised at the amount of useful skills you can demonstrate in answering this question well – as long as you adequately describe the resolution (and its impact), as well as the problem. If in doubt, always follow [the STAR technique](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/star-technique-what-you-need-to-know/).  

And don’t worry if things didn’t run smoothly. It wouldn’t be a difficult situation if they did. In fact, hiding away from any slip-ups will only make your example come across clichéd. Instead, use them to show how you’ve learnt to better cope in similar situations that may arise in the future.  

It’s also a good idea to prepare your example in advance – that way you should be able to leave any emotional bias out of it.  

Right answer: ‘I think it’s important to remember that determination can sometimes cause problems – even if the person means well. For example, I once managed someone who constantly met their targets – but their team work ethic was way off. Although they appeared successful, it turned out they were taking leads from colleagues. So I sat down with them to make them aware of the consequences, and stressed the importance of our team targets, rather than trying to work against each other. Not only did they turn things around, they also regained the respect of the team.’  

Wrong answer: ‘Well, they’re no longer on my Christmas list, that’s for sure…’
