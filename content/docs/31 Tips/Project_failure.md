**Hint:** Life is full of ups and down, successes and failures. The **role-coaster ride goes on** for most of us, basically since the day we are born until the day we die. In some periods of life successes may prevail and we may feel like standing on the top of the world. But sooner or later a huge setback arrives, **teaching us a lesson of humility and acceptance**.

Recruiters and hiring managers know that **we learn the most important lessons when things do not go as planed**. It’s then that we have to **use our creativity and try to change things**, or learn our lesson and quit, starting from scratch on another project, pursuing some other dream, or a new walk of life.

That’s why **questions about failures make a perfect sense in almost any interview**.
 Try to show the interviewers that you **take failures as they come, accept them, learn from them, and move on.** Do not blame others for the bad results. Accept responsibility. They expect such an attitude from the very best job candidates.

**Sample answers**

– Speaking honestly, I worked on many such projects in my life. I have always enjoyed venturing into the unknown, trying new things, innovating, experimenting. In my last job in sales I actually designed some new sales strategies, trying to capture leads on social media, such as Facebook groups. But I didn’t understand the platform well. After all my planning, and implementing, I actually captured only a few leads, and they did not convert anyway. However, I failed to reach my goal, but I learned something new and improved my skills with social media. I believe I will benefit from it in my professional career down the road.

– This is my first job application, and I have not worked on any real projects so far in my life. But I had my fair share of successes and failures, for example in personal life and relationships. Maybe you can call a relationship with a man a project… I definitely failed in one. But instead of crying over my misfortune, I tried to analyze the relationship and identify things that I did wrong. I wanted to do it better next time. I believe that the same attitude can be applied to failures in work. We cannot entirely avoid them, but it’s our attitude to failure that matters.

– Successful people do not fail. They either succeed, or learn. This is my attitude to both work and life. Surely as a manager I failed to reach my targets many times. If I always reached them, I would not be here interviewing for a job with you… But I did not consider it a failure. It would be a failure if I didn’t try hard enough, which was never the case. I tried my best, and it didn’t work out. Is it a failure? I would not say so. It’s a learning experience, something inevitable in a life of any successful man.

– I remember one demand forecast that went completely wrong. My employer paid the price, losing money in the process. But it was my mistake. What happened is that I underestimated certain market indicators, and was too optimistic in my analysis, predicting much greater demand for a certain product in the summer months. The company bought stock and proceeded accordingly, but my predictions were wrong and at the end of summer we ended up with a lot of stock that we could not sell during autumn or winter. But I prefer not think about it much. It happened, I learned my lesson, and I would not repeat the same mistake.

– I am just trying to get my first job with you, and have no previous working experience. Still young enough to experience some big failures, things that will shape me and teach me the most important lessons. However, you can be sure that I can admit making a mistake, and take responsibility for my actions. I will try to learn from my failures. And while this is an excellent company and you have a renowned training program for new hires, some failures will inevitably come. That’s the way it works in human life.

– My biggest failure so far was when I did not succeed in getting to a college of my choice. I prepared hard for the entrance exams and for the interviews, did what I could. It was not enough. At the end of the day, I simply had to accept that other candidates were better, and move on. But I already learned that a failure can be a blessing in disguise. Maybe I will get this job with you, make a great career in your company, and eventually end up happy that I did not succeed to get to college.
