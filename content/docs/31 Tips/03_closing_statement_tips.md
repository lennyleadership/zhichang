Completing the interview effectively is very important in increasing your chances of receiving an offer. An effective closing statement can make you unique from other candidates if they have the same work experience as you. In this article, we will discuss the example of an interview closing statement, explain why it is important, provide a list of 4 important closing sentences to say during an interview, and share tips on how to make a good impression.

**1. Simple but professional**   
 Example: *“Thank you for your time. It was great meeting with you, Mr./Ms. XX! I’m looking forward to hearing feedback, and don’t hesitate to contact me in the meantime if you have any questions or concerns.”*  
 This will help you know when to follow up and what to expect. If you don't get a response within a few days, you can get business cards from everyone you meet to make the follow-up process easier.

**2. Tell them about "why you should hire me”**    
 Example: *“Thanks for catching up with me. I’m excited about the position, and it sounds like a great fit based on my experience in X and Y. I’m looking forward to hearing about the next steps, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, thank you!”*  
 Tell more about your most powerful skills and experiences to influence the recruiter/hiring managers! Make them always remember you!

**3. Asking “what’s next?”**  
 Example: *“The job sounds great. I’m very interested because X and Y. So, what is the next step after this?”*   
 This statement is a great way to show them that you are interested in the job and confident that you can do it well. (It's always good to show confidence in an interview.) Ask about it at the end of the interview and you'll find out what's next.

**4. Finish with a polite conclusion**  
 Example: *"I'm very grateful for interviewing with you today. You have given me a clear overview of the position. I think my experience and accomplishments can provide value to the company. Is there anything else you need to confirm if I am the right candidate for this position?"*   
 A polite conclusion gives a positive impression to the recruiter/hiring manager, and that will also explain how you behave in a professional environment.
