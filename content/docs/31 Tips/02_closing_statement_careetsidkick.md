There are a couple of things employers *always* remember after an interview… and one of the big ones is how you close out the interview.

They’ll remember if you finished with confidence or seemed nervous. They’ll remember if you reaffirmed your interest in the job, or if you appeared uninterested. (Hint: It’s always better to show interest in the position and eliminate all doubt that they have).

So in this article, you’re going to get **four examples of good interview closing statements to end the conversation and get more job offers.**

**We’ll also look at what NOT to say and some big mistakes you need to avoid when closing… so make sure you read until the end.**

## 4 Interview Closing Statement Examples:

### 1. The simple, professional wrap-up:

> “Thank you for your time. It was great meeting with you, <NAME>! I’m looking forward to hearing feedback, and don’t hesitate to contact me in the meantime if you have any questions or concerns.”
> 

The only thing I might add is: Asking about next steps and when you can expect to hear feedback, like this: “Also, when can I expect to hear feedback, and who will be in touch?”

So feel free to add that piece, too. This will help you know when to [follow-up](https://careersidekick.com/follow-up-after-interview-no-response/) and what to expect. You can also get a business card from each person you met with, to make the follow-up process easier if you don’t hear from them in a couple of days.

Otherwise, I’d keep it short and simple, like the script above.

### 2. The “why you should hire me” recap

> “Thanks for meeting with me. I’m excited about the role, and it sounds like a great fit based on my experience in X and Y. I’m looking forward to hearing about the next steps, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime!”
> 

And as mentioned in the previous sample interview closing statement, you can then wrap up by asking when to expect feedback.

For example, they may say, “Likewise, it was great meeting with you. We’ll be in touch.”

Then you could say, “That sounds great! When can I expect to hear feedback, and who will be in touch with feedback?”

Then, get their business card and mark your calendar with the date you expect feedback so you can check in with them if that date passes.

**Now, these next two interview closing statements (#3 and 4) are more upfront. These are how you close an interview and ask for the job directly.**

### 3. Asking “what’s next?”

> “The job sounds great. I’m definitely interested. What is the next step?”
> 

This script is a good way to show them you’re interested in the job and that you’re confident in your ability to perform well in the role.

(It’s always good to [show confidence in your interviews](https://careersidekick.com/show-confidence-interview/)).

By asking this at the end of your interview, you’ll find out what’s next in the process, and they may even say they’re reading to offer you the role.

If you want to take matters into your own hands and ask them clearly and directly to offer you the position, then this next template is for you:

### 4. The confident ask: How to close an interview and ask for a job directly

> “I’m confident that this is the job I want. Is there anything preventing you from offering me the position today?”
> 

From here, they may say that they agree, and would like to put an offer together. Or, the hiring manager may say that they need time to meet with their team internally and discuss things. (Or meet with other candidates who they need to interview).

So don’t panic if you don’t hear “yes.” This was a gutsy, high-confidence move that sometimes works but is sometimes met with a “we need time to think.” So if that’s the case, just say:

> “I understand! I’m looking forward to hearing feedback when you and your team have made a decision. Do you have a sense of when I can expect to hear feedback?”
> 

By asking, you showed them that you’re confident and eager to land the position, and you’ve found out what the rest of the process will look like, which is valuable to know!

## What *Not* to Say at the End of the Interview:

There’s one statement that I see people recommend for the end of an interview, that I would never recommend.

**Here’s what people incorrectly recommend you say:**

> “Do you have any concerns about me as a candidate, or any reasons you would not hire me for the position?”
> 

While this may sound similar to example #4 (above), it’s not. The example above, which I recommend, is asking about the process overall and finding out whether they’re able to offer you the job based on all factors.

**However, asking them about concerns they have about you is a problematic way of ending your interview, for a few reasons:**

- It brings the negatives to their attention. You’re asking them to think of reasons they wouldn’t hire you for the job.
- They’re not going to tell you anyway, especially not on the spot like this
- The interview just finished and they need time to think about everything! It’d be equally odd if they asked you, “So, based on what we talked about, are there any reasons you wouldn’t accept this job?”

So if you want to make a lasting impression, finish your job interview with one of the four closing statement examples above.

That’s going to impress the interviewer more, get you better results in your job search, and help you find a position faster.

## Don’t Forget About Body Language

Make sure you conclude your job interview with great eye contact and a firm handshake, too. [Body language](https://careersidekick.com/body-language-tips/) matters just as much as what you say in a job interview.

You can have the best script in the world for how to end an interview, but if you don’t have the body language to back it up, it’s not going to be as impressive.

So think of body language as the other half of the puzzle in your interviews and job search. If you want to ace the interview and leave a lasting impression, make sure you look the part, too.

## Interview Closing Questions

You should also ask questions at the end of your interview (ideally, before closing your interview with one of the 4 example scripts above). This is another way for you to show interest in the job and impress the interviewer.

Here are two full articles dedicated to the top questions to ask an interviewer about the position, the company, and more:

## Conclusion: What To Do Next

As a next step, practice what you’ve learned above. Pick the closing statement that suits you best and rehearse it before your interview (including body language and tone of voice). Practice talking slowly and confidently. Practice your handshake with a friend or family member.

All of this will help you make a lasting impression on the interviewer so you can move to the next step in the process or receive a job offer!

Interviewers meet with a lot of candidates for each job, so practice EVERYTHING we talked about above if you want to make a good impression in the interview.

And then, after your job interview, send the interviewer a [thank-you note or email](https://careersidekick.com/thank-you-note-after-interview/) (I like email for most modern industries like tech, retail, healthcare, etc.). This is yet another tactic that will position you firmly in the interviewer’s mind and boost your chances of being hired.
