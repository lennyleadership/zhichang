[2022.10.05]
I did method development for one assay from scratch until the end of it at AECL, I did partial development work for two assays at LifeLabs.

Reminder: High level view, not much details. The difference can be used to form the answer.

**At AECL**:  
the throughput requirement,  
the reference methods,  
the instrumentation. (did not compare other column, set up temperature ramping rate, )

Regarding validation, I followed MISA protocol and the Standard Method, ran validation.

**At LifeLabs**:
The first assay I was involved in the method development partially was steroid profiling in urine.  The reason I said it was a partial development was because the method was developed and applied to the production before I joined on board


In summary:
