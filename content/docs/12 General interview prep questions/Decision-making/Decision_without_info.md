**Q: Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision, but didnâ€™t have all the information you needed.**

Sample excellent response:  
I had to make a decision recently between two configurations on one of our routers. Time was quickly moving away from me, and I had to have all the equipment back up in a matter of minutes. I chose the configuration that I had the most data on because I knew at least that I could better troubleshoot it if there was a problem. My decision was the right one.
