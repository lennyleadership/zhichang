**[2022.10.10] target the potential employer such as clinic diagnostic lab**  

Keywords:  
The technical specifications: specificity (isomers), selectivity, sensitivity, matrix effects, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) [false positive, false negative] 
The business requirements: the medical decision limit / clinical decision limit, the cost of assay, the length of development time (it could take 6 months or 18 months),
The operation requirements: throughput. 
The project requirements: Work around the operation schedule.  

factors to be considered / steps:  
1) tune the mass spectrometer, positive mode or negative mode. read papers.  I had experience in 7 alpha C4 bile acid metabolite project.    
2) select column, beginning with current column, working with mobile phases, and pH adjustment (modifiers). I had experience in 7 alpha C4 bile acid metabolite project
3) work with sample preparation. I had experience in the Solid Phase Extraction in hydrolysis of steroid. Tools that I used were: experimental design, statistical analysis,  

teamwork: scientists, vendors, technologists  

I have not done validation.  

I have knowledge of receiver operating characteristic (ROC)


**[2022.10.10] target the potential employer such as AECL / CNL**    


I did method development and method validation.  I passed the proficiency test.  

I stuck to use the current column, followed by optimizing the temperature ramp program, identified quantifier and qualifier. 
no sample preparation, but taking a tip of adding salt to increase sensitivity.  challenge was the contaminated water blank, mostly methylene chloride.

**[2022.10.05]**  
I did method development for one assay from scratch until the end of it at AECL, I did partial development work for two assays at LifeLabs.

Reminder: High level view, not much details. The difference can be used to form the answer.

**At AECL**:  
the throughput requirement,  
the reference methods,  
the instrumentation. (did not compare other column, set up temperature ramping rate, )

Regarding validation, I followed MISA protocol and the Standard Method, ran validation.

**At LifeLabs**:
The first assay I was involved in the method development partially was steroid profiling in urine.  The method was developed before I joined in, and I was responsible for developing a process that 1) can automate the sample preparation, and 2) can deconjugate all steroid conjugates.  [achievements in two months. overcame challenges in two months, team work, commitment, collaboration, design experiments]  

The second assay I was involved in the method development partially was 7 alpha C4 bile acid metabolite in serum.  At first, I developed a GC-MS/MS method. The analyte was derivertized.  The advantage of GC-MS/MS method is: less matrix effect to the mass spectrometer; less isomer effect.  The disadvantage of GC-MS/MS is: derivatization, longer sample preparation.
