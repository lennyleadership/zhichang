[2022.10.05]  
I did method development for one assay from scratch until the end of it at AECL, I did partial development work for two assays at LifeLabs.

Reminder: High level view, not much details. The difference can be used to form the answer.

**At AECL**:  
the throughput requirement,  
the reference methods,  
the instrumentation. (did not compare other column, set up temperature ramping rate, )

Regarding validation, I followed MISA protocol and the Standard Method, ran validation.

**At LifeLabs**:
The first assay I was involved in the method development partially was steroid profiling in urine.  The method was developed before I joined in, and I was responsible for developing a process that 1) can automate the sample preparation, and 2) can deconjugate all steroid conjugates.  [achievements in two months. overcame challenges in two months, team work, commitment, collaboration, design experiments]  

The second assay I was involved in the method development partially was 7 alpha C4 bile acid metabolite in serum.  At first, I developed a GC-MS/MS method. The analyte was derivertized.  The advantage of GC-MS/MS method is: less matrix effect to the mass spectrometer; less isomer effect.  The disadvantage of GC-MS/MS is: derivatization, longer sample preparation.   


In summary:
