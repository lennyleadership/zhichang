[2022.10.05]
I did method development for one assay from scratch until the end of it at AECL, I did partial development work for two assays at LifeLabs.

Reminder: High level view, not much details. The difference can be used to form the answer.

**At AECL**:  
the throughput requirement,  
the reference methods,  
the instrumentation. (did not compare other column, set up temperature ramping rate, )

Regarding validation, I followed MISA protocol and the Standard Method, ran validation.

**At LifeLabs**:
The first assay I was involved in the method development partially was steroid profiling in urine.  The method was developed before I joined in, and we intended to: 1) automate the sample preparation, and 2) substitute for enzyme.


In summary:
