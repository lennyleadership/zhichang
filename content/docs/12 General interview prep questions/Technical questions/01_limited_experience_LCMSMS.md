How / What do I convince them that is okay?  
Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) 

1) I started with learning GC-MS/MS.  I had experience and fundamental knowledge with GC-MS, I took a couple of hours training on the quantitative module of MassHunter by an Agilent field service engineer. I self-learned the qualitative module on my own.  
I continued learning LC-MS/MS on the job, including tuning the MS, monitoring the back-pressure.
Thirdly, I enhanced experience of LC-MS/MS in my time.

Achievements:  
    The program of instrumentation is a piece of cake.  
    i) I developed VBA macro to process data.  
    ii) I did text mining in autotune reports, and plotted the trend of EMV data.  

2) when problem comes up, I have tools to use, I can contact the vendor.  I will take a note on my logbook.  I have a plan of implementing an electronic troubleshooting logbook.
