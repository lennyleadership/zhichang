*Most workplaces have people with a wide variety of skills and personality traits working together to achieve the goals of the company. Being a great leader requires the ability to adapt to the unique needs of everyone you work with and to create a positive and productive work environment. This article focuses on employees who create challenges in the workplace and discusses the best practices for managing those employees*.



## What is a difficult employee?

A difficult employee is a term used to describe a person who acts in a careless, unprofessional or irresponsible manner in the workplace. Difficult employees may challenge the authority of their leaders, create a negative or disruptive work environment for their peers or struggle to meet personal performance expectations. It is important to understand that difficult employees often are not intentionally being difficult, but are instead responding to challenges in their personal or professional lives that are impacting their ability to perform or behave appropriately.

## How to manage difficult employees

Effective management strategies help leaders encourage and support all employees in overcoming challenges and contributing to the success of the organization. Use the following steps to help you manage difficult employees in an effective manner:

### 1. Acknowledge and identify the problem

When dealing with difficult employees, you must begin by acknowledging a problem exists and identifying what the problem is. Try to be as specific as possible when identifying the issues the employee is creating in the workplace. If there are several concerns about the employee’s behavior or work performance, make sure you identify each one. Document specific examples of each problem.

### 2. Find the positives

It is just as important to identify the positive characteristics and actions of a difficult employee as it is to identify the issues. Identifying several positive traits or accomplishments to discuss along with your concerns helps you minimize the risk of the meeting with the employee becoming confrontational and unproductive. Employees respond best to critical feedback when they feel their value is also being acknowledged.

### 3. Ask for the employee’s feedback

It is also important to get the employee’s feedback about their performance, behavior and concerns. Schedule a private meeting with the employee and inform them of the reason for the meeting. Give them time to prepare for the meeting. Your primary goal for the meeting is to discover the root causes creating issues with the employee’s performance or behavior.

Begin the meeting by asking the employee if they are aware of how their performance or behavior is impacting the company. Then ask them if there are any concerns they have or if there is anything they want to discuss. Listen closely to what the employee has to say. Informing the employee that the goal of the discussion is to find solutions you can work on together helps you proactively diffuse confrontational situations.

### 4. Create an action plan and document it

Work with the employee to create an action plan to address concerns together. Make sure they know your expectations, the process for measuring progress and the consequences for failing to meet expectations or make improvements. Identify the specific actions they need to take to help them achieve their goals. Ask them if they need access to any tools or resources to help them make improvements and offer support where you can. Establish appropriate time frames for completing each portion of the action plan. Make sure you document everything in writing and provide the employee with a copy.

### 5. Follow up consistently

Give the employee sufficient time to implement corrective action, and monitor their progress during that time. Establish a schedule for check-ins with the employee to discuss their progress and provide additional feedback. If they are making improvements, it is important to recognize those improvements. If they are continuing to struggle, begin a new conversation to find the reasons they are struggling to progress and try to think of new solutions.
