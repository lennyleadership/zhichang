Here are 3 ways you can overcome the resistance between you and your coworkers and reach an agreement.

1. Listen to what she has to say, without judging.

2. Respect her enough to see her opinion is as valuable as yours.

3. Find the common ground and make your moves from there.

Moving Forward   
You've listened.   
You've shown respect.  
You've moved toward some common ground.  
Do all these things regularly with those you work with, and you'll get a lot more accomplished - together. You'll all be happier, more civil, and more cooperative.  
And you might just change the world!
