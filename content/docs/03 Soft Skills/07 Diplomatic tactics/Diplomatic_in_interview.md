## When to apply diplomacy skills in a job interview.

There are many occasions when diplomacy is your best choice in a job interview.

Diplomacy is an art. It involves being as truthful as you can without being negative. Using diplomacy in a job interview is an opportunity to show off your emotional intelligence and communication skills.

A diplomatic interview answer will involve appearing professional at all times. The following interview questions provide examples of diplomatic answers.

## Why Are You Leaving Your Current Role?

Recruiters use this question to highlight any career related issues. These include not getting along with others, personality issues or not being able to commit to a role. This is not the time to rant about the culture of your current organisation. It is unprofessional to complain about your company. If you do so, a recruiter is likely to think you would continue to do this in a new role.

Studies have shown that poor leadership is a contributing factor to high employee turnover rates. Having said that, never criticise your current boss in a job interview. You don't know whether he/she is known by the interviewer. It is important to stick to the facts and to not get emotional in your response. (Even if your current boss is why you are leaving your role!)

This question is a good time to talk about your current role not being a good job fit, or that you are ready for a new challenge. It is also a good time to talk about why the new role attracted you.

## Why do you want this job?

This is never the time to talk about money. (Even if that is why you want the job!) This is also not the time to talk about how much you hate your current role. In response to this question you should be highlighting the value you can bring to their organisation. Discuss how your unique career experience addresses the key selection criteria.

This question can allow you to demonstrate how well researched you are about the role and where it fits in an organisation.

You can practice diplomacy in both your professional and personal life. It involves being honest without deliberately hurting anyoneâ€™s feelings or coming across as negative. Have you tried it? It will ensure you appear professional and may help you land the role.
