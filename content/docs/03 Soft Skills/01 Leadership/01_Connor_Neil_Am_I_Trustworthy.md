You know at 20 have good intent but not have the capacity and the discipline to deliver. That's okay. That's the process of learning. But if at 13, at 40, you still fail to be aware of where there are flaws in you, you still have an intent to fail to get results. Now you are not trustworthy. And it's a problem. So it's rule of logging. Number one, don't film underneath the flight path to the Barcelona International Airport.

Conor here in Castelldefels, on the beach, 20 minutes from Barcelona. This Friday, Saturday, I was teaching ESA Executive MBA with my good friends Luis Suarez and Tony Anago. Our course was fundamentally on the subject of "Am I trustworthy?". Reminds me, I heard a podcast by Marcus Lemonis was one of the Dragon's Den investors on the American edition of the game show. 

And there's a conversation where the question to Marcus is, what do you look for in a business? You've been very successful investing in businesses, what are you looking for? And he says, he thinks a little bit of, then says, when I go in to the business, essentially, I want to see that the owners, the decision makers aren't idiots. And I liked that he thought about this. And then what is what makes what makes the owner what makes the manager what makes a director of a business, an idiot.

unawareness of the impact that he has on others, unawareness, unawareness that when he thinks he's being good, his impact on others is actually negative. Luis was shared with the group on Friday, model four aspects of what it takes to be trustworthy, and the four aspects of what it takes to be trustworthy.

Number one, is <mark>integrity</mark>. Number two, <mark>transparency</mark>. Number three, <mark>competence</mark> and number four <mark>results</mark>. And by sunglasses on sun is in my eyes, integrity. You know who you are, you know what's important to you. And you have stopped giving your time to things that do not matter to you. So integrity is you know, who you are. openness. Other people know who you are. Other people know why you're motivated, do things you do other people understand when and where they can count on you. So integrity is about you and understanding who you are. Openness is about how you let others know this fundamental who that is in you. If you've got integrity, you know who you are. If you've got openness, other people know who you are, it still doesn't make you trustworthy. All the good intent in the world doesn't matter. If you don't have the skills to deliver on what matters, and you don't have the discipline. To both hold yourself and hold others accountable. And to be fair with others, but also know where the limits are and be able to be assertive when others are overstepping the bounds or underperforming. 

And these four aspects are necessary if you are to be someone worthy of trust, integrity, openness, competence, and results. And I'll stick a link down below to some Luis Suarez material on trustworthy but this is such a fundamental aspects Jim Collins is the number one most important thing in business, selecting, motivating, and putting the right people in the right seats.
