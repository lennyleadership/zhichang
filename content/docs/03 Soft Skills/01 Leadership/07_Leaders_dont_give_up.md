Leaders don't give up.

Unlike followers, leaders know it's not over till it's over.

It's a strange mix of confidence, optimism, and stubbornness that keeps them going when everyone else gives up. That attitude is contagious.

Show me a developing organization and I'll show you a leader who has fostered a culture of perseverance.

A contagious competitive spirit.
A culture of mutual support.
An environment that attracts like-minded people.

With only a few seconds left on the clock, he made a play that made one of his peers the hero instead of himself.

Champions are rare. So if you find someone with a history of helping others win, run with them.

Theyâ€™re so relentless to the point where at times you'll feel like they're NON STOP. Overworked at times.

That's when you'll find out if you truly want to win by putting in the work or merely wanted to win without any effort.

Your TRUE yearning will reveal itself. If you don't pass the willpower test, you'll be screened out.

If you succeed, you'll be a leader. And maybe one day a champion.

Tag someone you know is a champion.
