<b><font class = "font_upper">There are three scenarios of method development</font></b>:

1) There are reference methods.  
The reference methods could  be ASTM, AOAC standard methods, and EPA methods.  I had this scenario at AECL.  

2) There are no reference methods, but some researchers did similar work before and they published them.  So there are something we can start with.  
I had this scenario at LifeLabs.

3) There are no reference methods, and no paper on same analysis.  So we need to start from somewhere and figure it out.


<b><font class = "font_upper">There are considerations for method development</font></b>:
1) Regulatory requirement of reporting detection limit  
the method detection limit must be lower than that,   

2) Interference  
isobaric compounds, isomer compounds  
matrix effects (useful for designing sample preparation)  


3) cost-effective
how long would the analysis run? (cut VOC method down to 15 min.)  
What SPE cartridge are available,

4) details level  
column, buffer, pH, mobile phase, ESI optimization, dwell time, detection limit, recovery, 


<b><font class = "font_upper">Steps</font></b>
1) standard infusion  
collision energy, positive mode, negative mode  

2) separation from isobaric compound

<b><font class = "font_upper">Useful Tools</font></b>  
Design of experiments because some variables are interactive.
