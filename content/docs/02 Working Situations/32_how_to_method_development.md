<b><font class = "font_upper">There are three scenarios of method development</font></b>:

1) There are reference methods.  
The reference methods could  be ASTM, AOAC standard methods, and EPA methods.  I had this scenario at AECL.  

2) There are no reference methods, but some researchers did similar work before and they published them.  So there are something we can start with.  
I had this scenario at LifeLabs.

3) There are no reference methods, and no paper on same analysis.  So we need to start from somewhere and figure it out.


<b><font class = "font_upper">There are considerations for method development</font></b>:
1) Regulatory requirement of reporting detection limit  
the method detection limit must be lower than that,   

2) Interference  
isobaric compounds,   
matrix effects (useful for designing sample preparation)  
isomer compounds

3) cost-effective
Run time (cut VOC method down to 15 min.)  

4) details level
