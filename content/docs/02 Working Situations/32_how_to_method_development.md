There are three scenarios of method development:

1) There are reference methods.  
The reference methods could  be ASTM, AOAC standard methods, and EPA methods.  I had this scenario at AECL.  

2) There are no reference methods, but some researchers did similar work before and they published them.  So there are something we can start with.  
I had this scenario at LifeLabs.

3) There are no reference methods, and no paper on same analysis.  So we need to start from somewhere and figure it out.
