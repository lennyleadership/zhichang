Q: How did you make a decision?  
How did you make decision when you did not get enough information?  

There was a time we made a decision when purchasing a new LIMS.  Although I was not the person who made final decision, I was involved in the decision-making process.  

May I share with you?  


Identified problem: The ASB had LabWorks LIMS based on Window 3, we updated to LabWorks LIMS based on Window XP in 2010. 

Gathered information: I collected information of end-users' needs and documented desired configurations of LIMS.  

Generated alternatives: I learned that the old LIMS did not meet our needs.  I looked into other LIMS vendors.

Chose appropriate action although it was not the best decision: I submitted the document for consideration, 

The decision was made to choose LabWorks LIMS because:  
1) short time frame  
2) off-shelf product, no customization, difficult to upgrade and update from IT perspective.

The LIMS was a compromised product.

During the implementation, I administered it, contacted IT group for support, 

The reasons I want to share with you are these:  
1) There are components for decision-making, such as collection of information, list of alternatives, involvement of others, commitment to making it work.  
2) Such decision affected our operation profoundly.  
3) I was persistent to make improvement, and looked for work-around solutions.
