or in another word: what is the strategy to ensure the quality in peak season? 
[2022.02 BV Burnaby Scientist interview, asked this twisted question.]

Approach #1: The process control from sample log-in till reporting.  
* Log-in:  
1) typo of sample ID.  

* Sample preparation:  
1) missed surrogate standards, internal standards.  

* Instrument analysis:
1) Type dilution
) Group every 15 samples into batches. Insert QC samples.  
) Set warning limits.  
) QC samples: a standard at low concentration, duplicates, spiked sample,   

* Data process:  
) copy and paste a cell in which there is formula.   
) Alternatively use VBA.  


Approach #2: Tricks
* Use surrogate standards, internal standards.  
* Use QC samples.
