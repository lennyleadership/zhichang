It is important to be receptive to others' ideas and opinions.  Tell us about a time when you had to elicit comments or feedback from another team member on an important issue.

Action: 
year 2013, used Calendar at SharePoint to keep track of leave and absence for our group. I approved timesheet.  It was shared with my manager and secretary.

Feedback: 
It is okay to use SharePoint calendar to let others know when coworkers are taking time off.  However, I do not believe it to be appropriate to put in what they are taking the time off for, nor what sort of leave they are using to take this time off with, especially since some of this information is personal, and invades individuals privacy by sharing this information.

The nature of the information currently displayed in it is not.
