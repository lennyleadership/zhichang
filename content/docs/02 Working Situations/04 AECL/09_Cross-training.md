huddle meeting, cross-training.  The technologist A was asked to train the technologist B on ICP.  Both of them did not get alone.  Technologist A insisted that technologist B can't run the routine sample until they are proficient.

Karen suggested to train technologist B on QC samples.  What did I do to train Kent on GCMS?  Karen addressed the matter rather than conflicts.
