Q: How did you build trust in relationship?

First of all, I hold myself accountable to tasks. I would use a term "ownership". I hold myself accountable to my promise. 

Situation / Point #1: Karen Ross' comment: I trusted Lenny. Situation: LIMS issue; Pamela Yule

Situation / Point #2: Kent's comment: Could I ask you for reference check.
How did I make it? 
Sub-situation #1: Conflict management. Think about how I could do better, do differently next time. I took an inside -out approach.
Sub-situation #2: Recognized achievement, acknowledgement. Do something for their good.
