Spec sheet of Varian GC/MS @ AECL

<!--more-->

Injector:	1177 type  

Column: CP-Select 624CB  

GC: 3800  

Detector: model 300 single-quadrupole MS.  

The EI source consists of an ion volume, a filament assembly, electron collimating magnets, and ion focusing lenses, all supported by a heated ion block.  The ion volume is an open cylinder with two side holes. Vaporized sample and carrier gas from the GC enters the ion volume through the transfer line in one of the holes.  An electron beam, generated at the heated filament, enters the ion volume through the other hole.  The accelerated electrons collide with the sample molecules inside the ion volume and generate molecular ions.  The resulting ions fragment into differently charged or neutral fragments. The ions enter the mass analyzer [17].
