Q: Give us an example of a time when establishing two-way communication with an individual or group was especially challenging.  

---
Case #1: Refer to the conflict with a coworker in training (#02 conflict resolution).  

---
Case #2: Leverage coworker's influence to resolve the situation in correcting error in analysis.  
I checked an ICP-OES report, observing QC data were off.  I returned the report to the technologist and pointed out the error in QC data.  They were confident in data and blew up.  They challenged me that I was wrong.
