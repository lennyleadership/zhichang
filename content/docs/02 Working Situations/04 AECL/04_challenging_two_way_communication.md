Q: Give us an example of a time when establishing two-way communication with an individual or group was especially challenging.  

---
Case #1: Leverage coworker's influence to resolve the situation in correcting error in analysis.  
I checked an ICP-OES report, observing QC data were off.  I returned the report to the technologist and pointed out the error in QC data.  They were confident in data and blew up.  They challenged me that I was wrong. 

---
Case #2: Regulations and procedures are difficult to read and quite often interpreted differently.

There was a time, I wanted to clarify the reporting requirement of rounding and significant figures in a couple of regulations.  I contacted an Environmental Specialist at Chalk River rather than an Environmental Specialist at Whiteshell because I used to go and consult the Specialist at Chalk River.

They were personally offended about the method I chose to go about inquiring requirement, and felt I made them look incompetent in front of their superiors and regulators.  

clarify that there was no malicious intent in my actions.

My situation: I had no idea of the reporting line.

At the end of the conversation, both of us agree on expectation: If we disagree on some issue and you want to go to the higher ups to get clarification, just run it by them.
