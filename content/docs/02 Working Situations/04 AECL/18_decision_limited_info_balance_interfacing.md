Limited time frame: software trial period  

Considered three software.

What we did:  
We received two software trial version.  

I setup the configuration.  
Neil Peitsch - QA, Chantelle Kryschuk - lab tech, and I tested trial version of two software and attended a Webex for the third software.  
[Details of testing: two primary applications: a pipette calibration spreadsheet and an ICP spreadsheet.]  

I collected pros and cons of three software.  

I made a decision in a short period of time.  Work as a team, get people involved.
