approved timecard.  

To ensure we have a consistent approach on the use of sick leave for medical appointment.

HR has advised that sick leave should be used for the time spent at medical appointment and the travel time to and from the appointment only (normally 1 to 4 hours). If the employee decides to take the remainder of the day off, it must be pre-approved and it should be recorded as personal leave (banked time taken, personal business, vacation). 

I rarely take sick time and when I do, I do it because I need to. This is just another example of a policy that **punishes everyone for the abuse of a few**. Go deal with the people that are abusing sick leave. I’m re-submitting my timesheet.   

The process that we are following is consistent with RCW-2.39 which states “an employee will be limited to one-half day’s sick leave for such an appointment, or one day if the appointment is required outside the area”.  “Limited” means up to a maximum.  No changes will be made to your timesheet.

Daisy's comments: it is not a good example, because it did not exemplify my strength and competency.

What does the hiring manager want to probe?
- compliance?  
- how to communicate with others?
