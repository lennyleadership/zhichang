Tell me about a time when you had to present a proposal to a person in authority and were able to do this successfully.

n the second year when I joined in AECL as the Chemist, I introduced an interfacing program with balance to my supervisor.  I explained that it can transfer reading from a balance to an Excel file so that we can eliminate human error and save time to populate data for the analysis at the next step and reporting.  I also emphasized that it did not cost a lot, just $500.  The supervisor took my suggestion, tested trial versions of two programs and bought it.  I installed it, and demonstrated co-workers to use it.  The weighing process became more efficient, and the data quality was increased.  

Limited time frame: software trial period  

Considered three software.

What we did:  
We received two software trial version.  

I setup the configuration.  
Neil Peitsch - QA, Chantelle Kryschuk - lab tech, and I tested trial version of two software and attended a Webex for the third software.  
[Details of testing: two primary applications: a pipette calibration spreadsheet and an ICP spreadsheet.]  

I collected pros and cons of three software.  

I made a decision in a short period of time.  Work as a team, get people involved.
