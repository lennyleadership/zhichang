Tell me about a time when you had to present a proposal to a person in authority and were able to do this successfully.

n the second year when I joined in AECL as the Chemist, I introduced an interfacing program with balance to my supervisor.  I explained that it can transfer reading from a balance to an Excel file so that we can eliminate human error and save time to populate data for the analysis at the next step and reporting.  I also emphasized that it did not cost a lot, just $500.  The supervisor took my suggestion and bought it.  I installed it, and demonstrated co-workers to use it.  The weighing process became more efficient, and the data quality was increased.
