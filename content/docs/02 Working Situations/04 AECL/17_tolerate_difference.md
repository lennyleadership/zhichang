Tell me about a time when you were tolerant of an opinion that was different from yours.

From technical / quality management aspect,  
Case 1: When I worked at AECL as the Chemist, I reviewed analysis reports.  The lab analysts brought me their logbook and analysis reports.  I am a meticulous person.  I looked very close to the raw data on logbooks.  There was a time, I noticed that analyst A did not follow the rule of rounding data on the logbook.  I left a sticky note requesting the analyst to fix it and returned it.  I believe we should maintain the professional level not only on the report, but also on the logbook.  The analyst A walked away and vented to analyst B.  Later on, the analyst B suggested I letting it go, and picking a fight.  I went to explain the situation with my manager.  My manager suggested giving analysts time to grow.  As a result, I tolerate the way of rounding off raw data on the logbook.
 
Case 2: When I worked at AECL as the Chemist, we used a distillation method to determine ammonia in aqueous samples.  It took time to distill the samples.  I shared my knowledge of flow injection analyzer (FIA) with the senior technologist, and got his opinion on the new method.  Once we setup the analysis on the FIA instrument, the analyst could walk away and work on different tasks; and the FIA method takes less time.  The senior technologist did not think it would make much difference in lab efficiency because of low sample volume and radioactivity. so I did not propose this method to our manager afterwards.
 
Case 3: Regarding regression mode for calibration curve. 
I suggested linear regression, but technologists suggested quadratic (polynomial) regression.


From lab management aspect,  
Case 1: Regarding the risk of installing a 6-port valve on the GC/MS instrument.  
I suggested I installed it, but the technologists concerned about waive of the service warranty, so they wanted to pay the service for installation.  With the room of the budget, I put my opinion aside, and went with their option.
