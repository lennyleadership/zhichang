Describe for me a situation where you persuaded team members to do things your way.  What was the effect?

From technical / quality management aspect,
In the second year when I joined in AECL as the Chemist, I introduced an interfacing program with balance to my supervisor.  After purchasing, a technologist was reluctant to try it.

I configured the setting, 
I demonstrated it showing the benefits,
I trained them,  
I created an Excel template.
I was not successful in persuading one technologist.

Excuse: not many weighting tasks.  

workflow: a PC connect to a balance. data in PC -> USB -> technologist PC. 


It was until the situation became stressful, they had multiple tasks.  Feedback of coworkers on this balance interfacing proved the benefit.  Coworker's influence worked.  IT also supported us.
