Background: 18 compounds on LC/MS/MS, 30 compound on GC/MS/MS.

The bioassay was developed as this: an urine sample was aliquoted into two portions, one portion was hydrolyzed with enzyme followed by derivatization and analyzed on GC/MS/MS. Another portion was diluted and analyzed on LC/MS/MS. Raw data were calculated and transformed finally.  

In 2021 when we were short of enzyme, we investigated an alternative enzyme from another supplier. A couple of experiments revealed that some steroid sulfates were not completely cleaved. An idea came up - steroid conjugates was firstly enzymic hydrolyized with enzyme, followed by solvolysis (conc. H2SO4 in methanol).

Focus on steroid conjugates: DHEA-gluc, DHEAS, testosterone-gluc, testosterone-sulf, Estriol-gluc, Estrone-sulf, Cortisol-gluc, Cortisol-sulf, pregnanediol-gluc

Problem: In an investigation of enzymatic hydrolysis of steroid conjugates (glucuronides and sulfates), we found out that several steroid sulfates, such as (testo-sulf and DHEAS) were not cleaved completely.

Glucuronides can be cleaved easily with enzymic hydrolysis. Sulfate is not.
Procedure:  
3) The sample is: mix of these steroid conjugates at the highest calibrator level. Solvent were either methanol or methanol:H2O.  
4) Sample process:  
Step#1: enzymatic hydrolysis;   
step#2 sample transferred to SPE, then dryout;   
step#3: solvolysis;  
step#4: SPE;  
step#5: reconstitution, LC-MS/MS.  
5) [my initiative: methanolysis]

Four SPE cartridges, three washing reagents, two eluting reagents.
