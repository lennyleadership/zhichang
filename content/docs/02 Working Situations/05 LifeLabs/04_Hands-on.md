## Back pressure correction
There was a time at LifeLabs.  The back pressure of a LC-MS/MS was built up over 600 bar.  The instrument stopped because the back pressure went up above the limit.  I disconnected the UHPLC column from the mass spectrometer.  Observed the back pressure reading.  The back pressure was still high, so I disconnected the UHPLC column from the guard column.  The back pressure dropped.  I knew the problem was in the UHPLC column.
I turned off the pump, took off the guard column, put the column back on in the reverse order, selected the mobile phase B at a low flow rate, and turned on the pump to backwash the column for 30 minutes.  The waste was collected in a weight boat.  When it was finished, I turned off the pump and put a new guard column and the washed column on, remaining the disconnection to the mass spectrometer.  I checked the back pressure reading.  It went down to the range from 300 â€“ 400 bar.  I accepted it, then turned off the pump and reconnected the column to the mass spectrometer.


## Routine maintenance

I had hands-on experience with Agilent 6470 and 6490 Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupling with 1200 UHPLC. 6470 has an ESI source equipped with Jetstream Technology, and 6490 has an ESI source equipped with iFunnel technology.

I did maintenance by following the maintenance schedule. It includes:  
1) cleaning up the ion source prior to the run,   
2) Cleaning up the needle,  
3) emptying the waste solvent container,   
4) replacing the pre-column every 100 samples,   
5) checking the back pressure, and  
6) Back-washing the column if needed. Change a new column when back pressure is still beyond the upper limit we set after back-wash.  

I went above and beyond the routine maintenance requirement. I built a proactive maintenance program for GC-MS/MS with R application. I could build a similar one for LC-MS/MS.
