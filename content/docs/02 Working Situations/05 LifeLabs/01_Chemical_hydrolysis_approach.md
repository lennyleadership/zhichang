Company: LifeLabs

The supply of enzymes used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates was short a couple of months after I joined in LifeLabs.  I was requested to investigate alternative materials to replace enzymes.  The conventional approach was to use similar enzymes from different suppliers.   All we needed to do was to run verification experiments, finding the volume of enzymes we use based on the activity of enzymes of different suppliers.  

The experiments turned out the enzyme substitute was not acceptable.  What did we do?  A medical scientist proposed a solvolysis approach which involved two steps.  Samples were hydrolyzed with enzymes, followed by methanol hydrolysis.  I proposed a methanolysis approach which involved only one step.  Samples were hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid in methanol.  

We did not have experience with chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further.  It was the risk.

My team lead and I decided to take a chance.  I read through lots of literature, designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis with solvolysis, and methanolysis, set up instrument configurations, and ran experiments.  To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late to work around the medical lab technologists' schedule using the automated SPE station.

I managed to finish the project within two months.  The project proved that the solvolysis approach was the best way to cleave steroid conjugates.

This example demonstrated:
1)	my commitment to the team's success
2)	I never settle down but always seek better solutions.

Lifelabs experienced shortage of enzymes which is used for hydrolyzing steroid conjugates in year 2021 due to pandemic.  I was requested to investigate feasibility of alternative to enzymes.  I firstly performed verification experiments with enzymes from a different vendor.  The outcome of experiments was a failure.

During the brain storming stage, a medical scientist proposed a two-step chemical hydrolysis; and I proposed an one-step chemical hydrolysis.  The team lead decided to go with the two-step approach firstly, one-step approach secondly.  

We did not have experience with both chemical hydrolysis for cleaving steroid conjugates, so it would take a longer time to develop a method, and the testing production would be delayed further.  It was the risk.

I read through lots of literature; designed experiments to compare three approaches: enzymatic hydrolysis, two-step hydrolysis, and one-step hydrolysis; set up instrument configurations; and ran experiments.  To speed up the project, I came early and stayed late; and worked around the operational schedule using the automated SPE station.

I managed to finish the project within two months.  The project proved that the two-step approach was the best way to cleave steroid conjugates.

This example demonstrated:
1)	my commitment to the team's success
2)	I never settle down but always seek better solutions.
