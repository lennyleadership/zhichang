From lab management aspect,  
Case 1: In early 2007, Accuracy Environmental Labs was acquired by Testmark Laboratories.  Accuracy Environmental Labs is located at Kirkland Lake, and Testmark Labs is located at Sudbury.  I was assigned as the lab manager.  I looked after the whole laboratory management.  A co-worker gave me a notice that she was about to quit and move to the new job.  Considering her 20 years of service with Accuracy Environmental Labs, I thought we should buy a gift to her.  I made a phone call to the financial manager about my proposal.  I asked if we could buy a gift within $50 to her for her 20 years of service.  By doing so, we recognized her contribution to the business, and Testmark built up relationship with local community.  My proposal got approved.
 
From technical / quality management aspect,  
In 2010 when I was Chemist at AECL. balance interfacing program.
