Add surrogate standard (Y for ICP, )


Instrument aspect:  
instrument commissioning, instrument validation, monitoring of instrument key parameter  
PM


Batch control aspect:  
QC samples (such as blank, spiked blank, spiked samples, duplicate samples)  
group of every 14 samples  

risk: typo of sample ID; typo of dilution factors


Data processing aspect:  
data transfer (weighing data) 
data processing (macro, protected equation)


People aspect:
training, cross-training
