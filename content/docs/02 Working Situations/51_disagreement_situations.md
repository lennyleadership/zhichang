<b><font class = "font_upper">Situation #1: Disagree with my supervisor when we hired a QA officer.</font></b>  
I expressed my concern about his experience on analysis.  He had no experience in lab.  The supervisor made the final decision.  I respected his decision, and worked with the QA officer.  The supervisor explained his reason after many years.  QA is often seen as a policeman, and lab people seems not receive their advice well due to the personality.  This person seems to have a soft approach, and would be fit in the team.  I fully agreed with the supervisor based on my interactions with the person.  

The reason I choose this situation is to show you my submission to the authority.

<b><font class = "font_upper">Situation #2: Disagree with my manager when she chaired the branch meeting.</font></b>  
She was a new-hired manager. She forgot safety moment at the beginning of a branch meeting.  I sent her an email reminding her the safety moment.  She appreciated me.

The reason I choose this situation is to address the disagreement on the one-on-one base.
