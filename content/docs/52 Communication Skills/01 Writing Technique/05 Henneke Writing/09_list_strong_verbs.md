## How to use strong verbs

  </div>
Do you ever read text and wonder …

*Why do the words jump off this page?*

*Why does this writing feel energetic and strong?*

*Why is it so fast-paced?*

And do you wonder why your draft text seems a tad limp in comparison?

It happens to all of us.

First drafts often require an injection of <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/power-words/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power</a> and pizzazz. First drafts are full of weak verbs, and weak verbs make your writing limp, flabby, and listless.

In contrast, strong verbs add action, vitality, color, and zest. So, the “secret” to writing with gusto is to choose stronger verbs.
</div>

## What are strong verbs?

Strong verbs engage your senses, and help readers picture a scene (verbs in <b>bold</b>):

<div class = "quote">
You feel the air <b>reverberating</b> when he <b>slams</b> his fist on the table. The teacups <b>jiggle</b>, his face <b>reddens</b>, and his voice <b>thunders</b>.
</div>

Strong verbs allow readers to visualize actions. Instead of only reading words, they’re drawn into your writing, experiencing your story.

But strong verbs don’t need to convey powerful action. Subtle action can evoke powerful feelings, too. For instance:

<div class = "quote">
He <b>cradles</b> the baby, <b>strokes</b> her dark hair, <b>tickles</b> her chin, and <b>hums</b> a lullaby.
</div>

Strong verbs are precise and concrete. In contrast, weak verbs are abstract and generic—they don’t help you visualize a scene. Examples of weak verbs are *“to be,” “to provide,” “to add,”* and *“to utilize.”* You can’t picture these words.

For instance, if someone <b>*provides</b>* feedback, is he <b>*shouting</b>* his comments? Or <b>*lecturing</b>* you with a smug face? Or perhaps <b>*scribbling</b>* a few suggestions in the margin of your handout?

You can’t picture *“provide feedback,”* but you can visualize *“shouting,” “lecturing,”* and *“scribbling.”*

## Examples: How strong verbs breathe life into abstract ideas

Over the weekend, I read Ray Bradbury’s “Zen in the Art of Writing.” I enjoyed his <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/word-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">word choice</a>, and I loved how his verbs breathe life into abstract concepts, like storytelling and the Muse.

For instance, he describes how he started writing stories based on lists of nouns:

> And the stories began to burst, to explode from those memories, hidden in the nouns, lost in the lists.
> 

And he writes about the Muse:

> The Muse, then, is the most terrified of all the virgins. She starts if she hears a sound, pales if you ask her questions, spins and vanishes if you disturb her dress.
> 

And on eating books:

> I tore out the pages, ate them with salt, doused them with relish, gnawed on the bindings, turned the chapters with my tongue!
> 

Bradbury’s choice of strong verbs (like “gnaw” and “douse”) adds zest and power. He uses few <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-use-adjectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjectives</a> and <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-use-adverbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adverbs</a> to keep his writing <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/story-pacing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast-paced</a>.

## Strong verbs in business writing

You might think strong verbs are only for fiction writers.

But that’s untrue.

Here’s Nancy Duarte in her book “<a href = "http://resonate.duarte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonate</a>” (about engaging your audience with story-based presentations):

> Throughout history, presenter-to-audience exchanges have rallied revolutions, spread innovation, and spawned movements.
> 

And:

> When a great story is told, we lean forward, and our hearts race as the story unfolds.
> 

And:

> Haven’t you often wished you could make customers, employees, investors, or students snap, crackle, pop, and move to the new place they need to be in order to create a new future?
> 

Here’s an example of Apple’s copy:

> So whether you’re listening to music, watching videos, or making speakerphone calls, iPhone 7 lets you crank it up. Way, way up.
> 

And:

> Apple Watch Series 2 counts more than just steps. It tracks all the ways you move throughout the day, whether you’re walking between meetings, doing cartwheels with your kids, or hitting the gym.
> 

*“To do”* in the last sentence is, of course, a weak verb. Apple’s copywriters could have changed *“doing cartwheels with your kids”* into *“cartwheeling with your kids”* without disrupting the rhythm and making the sentence stronger.

> It is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness and color.
> 

## How to choose strong verbs

No clear distinction exists between strong and weak verbs. It’s a gliding scale, and it’s up to you as a writer to decide how strong you’d like your verbs to be.

For instance, *“to walk”* is stronger than *“to go”* because it gives you an indication of how someone moved. But stronger options would be: *to saunter, to hike, to shuffle, to trudge, to stride,* or *to plod.* Each of these verbs gives you an indication of how someone walked:

- to saunter: picture a girl walking rather leisurely, perhaps peeking into the shop windows
- to hike: picture a woman in walking boots with a backpack, walking at a good pace
- to shuffle: picture an elderly woman moving ahead gingerly, hardly lifting her feet
- to trudge: picture a girl in wellies making a big effort, perhaps walking through the snow or mud
- to stride: picture a lady walking as if on the catwalk, with long strides
- to plod: picture a tired woman with sagging shoulders, walking rather tiredly

Strong verbs can also be used for <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/abstract-vs-concrete-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abstract language</a>. For instance, you could say you generated ideas during your brainstorm session. But how did your ideas arrive? For instance:

- A few ideas popped into your mind
- Your mind exploded with ideas
- A stream of ideas burst forward
- Ideas first trickled, then gushed forth
- The brainstorm session spawned a stream of ideas

Strong verbs are more precise than weak verbs; they can paint clear pictures—even of abstract activities like thinking and generating ideas.

## How to improve your sentences with strong verbs

Imagine this: how would readers experience your voice if you used fewer adjectives and adverbs?

Here’s an example of text, sagging under adjectives and adverbs:

<div class = "quote">
While quietly sitting at her wooden desk, she slowly formulated her thoughts and worked really hard to write her blog post. The next day she felt apprehensive and nervously hit publish. Would her audience be interested enough to read her content word-by-word?
</div>

To add energy to the text, the first step is to strip the content back to its bare bones:

<div class = "quote">
<s>While quietly sitting at her wooden desk</s>, she <s>slowly</s> formulated her thoughts <s>and worked really hard</s> to write her blog post. The next day she <s>felt apprehensive and nervously</s> hit publish. Would her audience <s>be interested enough to</s> read her content <s>word-by-word</s>?
</div>

The stripped down version lacks nuance and color. So, let’s try stronger verbs and add a little context:

<div class ="quote">
For hours, she sat at her desk. She wracked her brain, and slaved over her words to produce a blog post. And the next day? She hit publish with trepidation. Would her audience gobble up her words?
</div>

The thesaurus is your friend. Use a thesaurus to find more precise alternatives for weak verbs.

## Your word choice shapes your voice

Finding your voice is about experimentation.

Write a first draft quickly using the words coming up into your mind.

Then, review your draft. In which sentences can you replace weak with strong verbs?

Which verbs can be more precise? Which verbs are sensory? Which verbs have a strong emotional connotation?

Play with your words. Have fun. And discover your voice.


## A list of 351 strong verbs to inspire your writing

The list below is not exhaustive as many more strong verbs exist.

You can use a thesaurus to find other strong verbs, or keep an eye out for interesting verbs while reading.

To determine whether a verb is strong, ask yourself whether the verb has a sensory connotation. Does it make you hear, feel, smell, taste or see something? Does it paint a clear picture?


### Onomatopoeic verbs
<div class = "quote">

Onomatopoeic words express a sound, so they’re a sub segment of sensory verbs.

The word onomatopoeia comes from the Greek for making words—the sound has formed the word that represents it.

<b>Examples:</b>

*To crack, to tap, to snap, to sputter, to knock, to boom, to clap, to bang, to drum, to squeal, to bump, to chatter, to twitter, to chirp, to clank, to click, to click-clack, to tip-tap, to jingle, to jangle, to rattle, to tinkle, to hush, to murmur, to plop, to pop, to fizz, to sizzle, to swoosh, to gargle, to sizzle, to hiss, to burp, to hiccup, to whack, to thumb, to crunch, to creak, to squeak, to flutter, to giggle, to tee-hee, to cackle, to honk, to hum, to meow, to woof, to munch, to shush, to screech, to slosh, to squish, to whirr, to gnaw*

</div>

### Sensory verbs

<div class = "quote">
Sensory verbs are strong because they paint clear pictures in readers’ minds and make them feel something.

<b>Examples:</b>

*To sparkle, to shine, to brighten, to wipe out, to muddle, to dazzle, to spark, to glow, to shimmer, to glimmer, to beam, to ripple, to tickle, to thrill, to explode, to burst, to guzzle, to gobble up, to breeze through, to drool, to spit, to roar, to thunder, to reverberate, to resonate, to rumble, to flavor, to smooth, to rub, to tremble, to whisper, to vibrate, to pulsate, to throb, to quiver, to buzz, to sip, to slurp, to slobber, to blemish, to applaud, to clash, to bounce, to blend, to shake, to savor, to tantalize, to tittilate, to pinch, to stroke, to brush, to bathe, to hose, to douse, to shower, to drench, to spray, to sprinkle, to trickle, to splash, to seep, to slide, to slump, to tumble, to nose-dive, to fly, to float, to clog, to swoop, to propel, to dig in, to dip, to surge, to wolf down, to shovel, to gulp down, to roll, to soar, to curl up, to unfold, to weave, to swipe, to tear, to polish, to pale, to vanish, to spin, to weave, to intertwine, to buckle down, to button up, to pierce, to stick to*

</div>

## Strong action verbs—intransitive

<div class = "quote">
Action verbs propel a sentence forward, keeping readers engaged.

Instead of using weaker words like *walk* or *move*, try to describe the movement more precisely so readers can imagine the movement.

Intransitive verbs can stand on their own, without an object. For instance, *I walk* is intransitive because there’s no object that is walked by me. *I hit you* is transitive—you are the object as you are hit by me.

<b>Examples:</b>

*To stumble, to wobble, to swing, to lurch, to glide, to zip, to sail, to crash, to dive, to tiptoe, to pussyfoot, to duck, to flip-flop, to dilly-dally, to linger, to stall, to sway, to sink, to spurt, to hurry, to dash, to nip, to race, to whiz, to flit, to chew, to stroll, to sashay, to amble, to plod, to ramble, to loiter, to meander, to roam, to snake, to gallivant, to twist, to dance, to jig, to jive, to waltz, to tango, to swirl, to hop, to trip, to skip, to whirl, to gallop, to stride, to zoom, to trot, to dart, to sprint, to shoot, to leap*
</div>

### Strong action verbs—transitive
<div class = "quote">
Below follow examples of words related to holding, pushing, or hitting something.

You can use these verbs for both concrete and abstract concepts. For instance, you can jump-start an engine or you can jump-start your career. You can squeeze a stress ball, or you can squeeze more to-do’s into your calendar. A cow regurgitates grass, and a blogger may regurgitate worn-out topics.

<b>Examples:</b>

*To crank up, to flood, to snowball, to skyrocket, to catapult, to flick, to jump-start, to tackle, to grab, to grasp, to wrestle, to poke, to stir, to prod, to stab, to strike, to smash, to hit, to plunge, to drop, to dump, to drain, to squeeze, to topple, to ditch, to block, to muzzle, to electrify, to galvanize, to fire up, to ignite, to kindle, to whip up, to sharpen, to shock, to jolt, to beat, to regurgitate, to trigger, to pocket, to bat, to smack, to slap, to kick, to kick-start, to hammer, to nail, to club, to flog, to clutch, to hook, to cling, to grip*  
</div>

### Negative emotional verbs

<div class = "quote">
A verb like to fail has a strong negative connotation but doesn’t necessarily paint an unambiguous or vivid picture in a reader’s mind. Failure comes in different forms—you can marginally fail an exam or your start-up can fail utterly, and the feelings associated can vary. Do you sob for days? Do you fret you’re a failure? Do you feel crippled or bruised by the failure? Do you feel devastated or shrug your shoulders?

Below follow examples of more sensory verbs with negative connotations:

<b>Examples:</b>

*To choke, to strangle, to smother, to gag, to suffocate, to throttle, to cry, to howl, to sob, to blubber, to scream, to groan, to moan, to fret, to fume, to bleed, to nag, to steal, to kidnap, to ransack, to loot, to pilfer, to plunder, to snitch, to puke, to vomit, to yelp, to bark, to growl, to grumble, to mutter, to spout, to suck, to scold, to plummet, to collapse, to skid, to agitate, to slave, to labor, to wreck, to ruin, to cripple, to devastate, to decimate, to trash, to shatter, to torpedo, to sabotage, to capsize, to maul, to crush, to slash, to bruise, to hijack*

### Positive emotional verbs

<div class = "quote">
The verbs below paint strong positive [imagery](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/imagery-examples/) in your reader’s mind.

Your apple tree can blossom, and your blog can flourish. A magician might be spellbinding, but your blog posts can hypnotize readers, too.

<b>Examples:</b>

*To flourish, to thrive, to bloom, to blossom, to mushroom, to smile, to grin, to cheer, to raise, to boost, to lift, to bolster, to invigorate, to energize, to excite, to enliven, to fortify, to hearten, to embolden, to animate, to arouse, to hypnotize, to spellbind, to sweep off one’s feet, to fall in love, to treasure, to unclog, to clarify, to disentangle, to liberate, to relieve, to release, to unshackle, to cuddle, to nestle, to huddle, to snuggle, to embrace, to hug, to kiss, to massage, to cradle, to enfold, to envelop, to sprout*
</div>

## More Examples: 9+ Sentences With Strong Verbs

### 1. Strong verbs in Nora Seton’s kitchen

In her book *The Kitchen Congregation*, Nora Seton describes how she wanted her mother to spend more time with her when she was growing up:

> I needed her there with me while I rolled, crawled, wobbled, ran, trampled, and grumbled on the red linoleum tiles of our kitchen floor.
> 

It’s easy to picture the child rolling, crawling, wobbling etc on the kitchen floor? That’s how strong verbs help to paint <a href = "https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/imagery-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong imagery</a>.

The following sentence is from the same book, describing the soaking of the grains:

> All morning long the grains softened, gave in, soaked up, plumped, burst, spit their gluten and flavor into the dish.
> 

Strong verbs don’t always come in long strings like that. Sometimes they pop up just here and there in a sentence. Here’s Seton musing in the kitchen:

> I imagine a neutrino shower bombarding me, subatomic gunfire, zinging against the stainless steel in my hands and rocketing through the kitchen without trace.
> 

### 2. Strong verbs on storytelling

Jane Alison uses 3 strong verbs in the title of her book about storytelling: *Meander, Spiral Explode: Design and Pattern in Narrative*.

Alison suggests patterns are natural and uses strong verbs to describe such patterns:

> We follow natural patterns without a thought: coiling a garden hose, stacking boxes, creating a wavering path when walking along the shore. We invoke these patterns to describe motions in our minds, too: someone spirals into despair or compartmentalizes emotions, thoughts meander, heartbreak can be so great we feel we’ll explode.
> 

### 3. Strong verbs on writing, a cat, and a praying mantis

In her book *The Writing Life*, Annie Dillard describes what writing is like:

> This writing that you do, that so thrills you, that so rocks and exhilarates you, as if you were dancing next to the band, is barely audible to anyone else.
> 

And in her book *Pilgrim at Tinker Creek*, Dillard uses strong verbs to describes how her cat wakes her up in the middle of the night:

> He’d stick his skull under my nose and purr, stinking of urine and blood. Some nights he kneaded my bare chest with his front paws, powerfully, arching his back, as if sharpening his claws, or pummeling a mother for milk.
> 

And she describes a praying mantis laying eggs:

> It puffed like a concertina, it throbbed like a bellows; it roved, pumping, over the glistening, clabbered surface of the egg case testing and patting, thrusting and smoothing.
> 

Can you picture all the movements?

### 4. Strong verbs in the desert

In his book *The Secret Knowledge of Water*, Craig Childs describes a thunderstorm in the desert:

> It sounded like a block of marble cleaved open with a sledgehammer. The sky broke in two with thunder. Echoes pounded back, thrumming against my spine. Lightning shot to the southeast. The air exploded again. Lightning then fell all around, snagging on the higher terrain. Scraps of lightning showed from behind rock towers. I counted the canyons by how many echoes of thunder were returned. Four pulses of thunder: four canyons. Then I heard the tapping. Rain began to fall. Another bolt of lightning. The rain increased, dabbing my face, making the sound of bean-filled rattles. I could hear it up on the cliffs, rain sheeting against rock.
> 

In the above paragraph, the strong verbs describe a multi-sensory experience. There’s movement (*cleave open, break in two, explode*), sound (*pound, thrum, shoot, tap*), sight (*sheet*), and touch (*dab*).

### 5. Strong verbs describing an escape on horseback

In his book *All the Pretty Horses*, Cormac McCarthy describes Rawlins, Blevins, and John Grady escaping on horseback:

> The horse skittered past Rawlins sideways, Blevins clinging to the animal’s mane and snatching at his hat. The dogs swarmed wildly over the road and Rawlins’ horse stood and twisted and shook its head and the big bay turned a complete circle and there were three pistol shots from somewhere in the dark all evenly spaced that went pop pop pop. John Grady put the heels of his boots to his horse and leaned low in the saddle and he and Rawlins went pounding up the road. Blevins passed them both, his pale knees clutching the horse and his shirttail flying.
> 

Thanks to the strong verbs, you can see the boys escaping, almost feel the motion, and hear the noise of the hooves pounding up the road. The strong verbs include: skitter, cling, swarm, twist, shake, pound, clutch, and fly.
