If you're honest, at some point you'll have a coworker you just can't stand.

But since you have to work together, you smile and pretend it doesn't bother you at all.   


**Your Smile is Lying**  

Here's the problem.

Did you know that your true feelings always show in your voice?   
No matter how you try to fake it, if you're angry it will leak out. If you're nervous, your voice will reveal even the slightest quiver and hesitation. And if you're disinterested, it will take away from the melody you normally have when you're feeling great.   

So what's the solution?   

Acting classes?   

No.   

Should you just fire the person due to irreconcilable differences?   

That might be admissible in court if you're getting a divorce, but not in the workplace.


**The Power of Forgetting**

Sometimes it's really good to forget.   

The best thing you can do when you have to work with someone who annoys the snot out of you is to forget that you can't stand them.   

I'll bet you're standing there thinking, “Yeah, like I can do that.”   

If you can't, then you're dead in the water.


Three Reasons Why You Should Forget You Can't Stand That Annoying Coworker Here are some things to remember when dealing with someone who makes your life difficult.


**1. As people, they have value**.  

If you believe life is precious, you have to agree that people—all people—have value.   

Now what about vicious criminals whose sole purpose in life is to maim and kill? Don't they deserve to die?   

Sure.  

But let's think about this. When someone's behavior is reprehensible to the point of killing others, death is a reasonable punishment. But you'll notice that in our court system, that is **the last resort**. Why? Because we as a society value life. We want to **believe in second chances**. We want to give others every opportunity to make things right.    

And, if you were to be convicted of a murder you didn't commit, would you want to be quickly condemned to death? 

Sure, she may have some annoying habits like filing her nails during meetings. Maybe she's loud enough to hear across the building when she talks. But if she has a brain, she has the potential for good ideas. If she has friends, then she must be doing something right.  

And if she was hired, someone (maybe even you) thought she could do the job. So, give her respect as a fellow human being.   


**2. Everyone's opinion matters**.   

You won't always agree with other members of your team.   

That's okay.   

You're not always right.   

It's good to have debate on issues. For example, you can benefit from others' experience even when you both do the same thing. If she's had more success, wouldn't you like to know how she does it?   

Everyone has ideas. Since we're not all the same, it's good to use each other to get better. If you like basketball, will you be your best if you only practice shooting hoops by yourself?   

No, you need competition to prove how good you can be.   

Let your coworkers make you sharper.   

Then do the same for them.   


**3. Remember that when you don't like a suggestion someone makes, she may be right**.   
It's tempting to let your opinion of someone color your perception of how good her ideas can be.   

If you don't like someone, you're probably predisposed to think of her suggestions as worthless.   

Don't do it.   

Forget what you think about anyone. Listen with open ears. You might learn something. You might improve.   

Who knows, that suggestion might open the door to new opportunities that never existed before!  

You won't be able to take that action if you decide to be petty. 


**Now Move Ahead**   

Part of being an adult and a leader is being honest with yourself.

You may not like everyone. And it's true you won't like everyone the same no matter how hard you try. It's okay. Commit to respecting others—no matter what—and you'll be able to get things done.   

And you'll be the leader you dreamed you could be.  

And who knows? You might just turn an enemy into a friend.
