- *Sigh**

You know it’s time to knuckle down.

And finally write those web pages.

But you struggle to get started.

Is your writing good enough? Can you persuade readers to contact you? And buy from you? Can you make your content easy to read, engaging, and inspirational?

Good writing isn’t as hard as it seems.

Let’s start at the beginning, shall we?

## What makes a sentence good?

Picture yourself home alone. It’s Friday night.

You treat yourself to a glass of red Rioja Reserva, and you sit down in your favorite sofa to read the book you received from a friend. At last.

Your phone rings. But you let it ring. The neighbor’s dogs are barking, but for once you don’t hear them.

When you’re so engrossed in your book, you read complicated sentences with ease.

A sentence of 63 words? You gobble it up:

> If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.
> 

Now imagine yourself at your desk, starting to read the first out of more than one hundred unread emails in your inbox. How much time do you allocate to each email?

You might read [a short email](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-write-persuasive-emails/) word by word. But when it’s long? You glance. You skim. You try to extract its purpose as quickly as you can.

Most online readers are task-oriented (*Empty that inbox!* or *Get that flight booked!*). They’re not snuggled up in their favorite sofa, giving your words all their attention. They’re in fast mode. They’re itching to get a task done, so they can move on.

## The 5 keys to writing persuasive sentences for busy readers

1. **Be specific.** The biggest problem in business writing is generic gobbledygook. To avoid wishy-washiness, [add specific facts to your sentences.](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/details-marketing-copy/)
2. **Focus on your reader.** Good marketing copy doesn’t feel like a sleazy sales pitch. It’s a cozy conversation with your reader.
3. **Make your readers feel something.**  [Scrap weak words](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/weak-words/). Instead, add emotion or [paint a picture](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/metaphor-examples/). Make your content more dramatic with action sentences.
4. Keep your average sentence length at **a maximum of 14 words**. A lower average would be better. The examples below have on average 9 words per sentence, making them easy to read.
5. **Be concise.**  [Eliminate each redundant word.](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-avoid-wordiness/)
    
    Conciseness isn’t about the length of a sentence. A long sentence can be concise when each word is relevant and adds meaning.
    

Finding these 5 keys a little vague and abstract?

Let’s analyze a few examples …

## 5 examples of good sentences in business writing

### Example 1: a stylus for iPad

> Our adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page. Rest your hand on the screen, write from any angle. No calibration or setup. You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.
> 

4 sentences. 36 words.

Why these sentences are good:

- This paragraph is clearly focused on the reader, listing various benefits of adaptive palm rejection.
- The benefits are ranked using [the *So what?* method](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/features-and-benefits/):
    
    *The adaptive palm rejection instantly knows whether it’s your hand or Pencil touching the page.*  So what? *You can rest your hand on the screen and write from any angle.*  So what? *You’ll forget you’re creating on a tablet.*
    
- The benefits show a superb mix of problems you avoid—no mistaking your hand for your stylus, no calibration, no setup—and positive benefits—write from any angle, forget you’re creating on a tablet.

### Example 2: iPad Air

> Not just a thinner display. A better display.
> 
> 
> The displays on previous generations of iPad used three separate components. iPad Air 2 changes all that, combining those three layers into just one. This eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal reﬂectance caused by those gaps. The result? Colors are richer, contrast is greater, and images are sharper and more vivid.
> 

61 words. 7 sentences.

Why these sentences are good:

- The two opening lines, and the question *The result?* might all be crossed out by your high school teacher because they’re broken. But these broken sentences add a dynamic rhythm to Apple’s writing. Read the paragraph aloud and you’ll hear what I mean. Apple copywriters are the masters of broken sentences.
- The technical explanation is specific—three simple sentences explain why iPad Air 2 is thinner (because it fuses three layers into one), and why this means the display is better, too (no gaps so no internal reflectance).
- After the technical explanation, the closing line returns back to the reader by explaining what it means for the reader to have a better display. This sentence harnesses the [power of three](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/rule-of-three-in-writing/)—highlighting three benefits in a row (colors, contrast, and images).

### Example 3: A curry (ready-made meal)

> You’re in Vietnam. You’ve whizzed around Hanoi in a rickshaw. You’ve walked around admiring the rice fields and the meandering waterways of the Mekong Delta. You’ve smiled and nodded enthusiastically at some happy locals. And right now you’re settling down for a delicious, flavoursome meal of udon noodles, veg, tasty sauce and spices. Enjoy (chopsticks optional).
> 

6 sentences. 56 words.

Why these sentences are good:

- The [first sentence](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-write-an-opening-sentence/) is sublimely short, making it easy for your reader to start reading the next sentence.
- [The text paints a clear picture](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/how-to-write-with-clarity/) by using vivid imagery—*rickshaw, meandering waterways, Mekong delta*.
- The text is action-focused, adding drama—*you’ve whizzed, you’ve walked, you’ve smiled and nodded*. Do you find yourself smiling, when your read this, too?
- This vivid [description](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/descriptive-writing/) elevates eating curry to an exotic experience full of joy.

### Example 4: Gifts for guys

> We say ‘no’ to ugly neckties, cologne samplers and executive trinkets. We don’t save wrapping paper, we don’t do ribbons.
> 
> 
> We ship bragworthy gifts for guys.
> 

3 sentences. 26 words.

Why these sentences are good:

- How specific can you get? Man Crates doesn’t tell us they dislike boring gifts for men. They tell us specifically what type of gifts they don’t like. Pretty clear, isn’t it?
- The sentence *We ship bragworthy gifts for guys* is more persuasive after the explanation of what they don’t do.
- Man Crates speaks strongly to their target audience. Note, for instance, the word *bragworthy*—according to some dictionaries it’s not even a word.

### Example 5: Web hosting

> Is your website up? More importantly, are search engines and subscribers receiving your content? If you are a content publisher, you need to know. But unless you are actually on the site, how do you know?
> 

4 sentences. 36 words.

Why these sentences are good:

- Want to speak strongly to your reader? Then enter the conversation already going on in your reader’s mind. That’s exactly what these questions do.
- Did you find yourself quietly nodding *yes*, while reading these questions? When you start nodding *yes*, you’re more likely to say *yes* to their offer of web hosting, too. This is what psychologists call the *consistency principle*. Once we’re in the mood for saying *yes*, we keep saying *yes*. In [my free snackable course](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/free-writing-course/) I explain this *power of the subtle nod*.

## Good writing starts with an appreciation of sentences

I like this anecdote that Annie Dillard shares in her book *The Writing Life*:

> A well-known writer got collared by a university student who asked, “Do you think I could be a writer?”
> 
> 
> “Well,” the writer said, “I don’t know…. Do you like sentences?”
> 
> The writer could see the student’s amazement. Sentences? Do I like sentences? I am twenty years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, “I liked the smell of the paint.”

## The truth about writing a good sentence

[Writing for business](https://www.enchantingmarketing.com/good-business-writing/) isn’t like academic writing.

Don’t show off your intelligence. Don’t brag about your command of words originating from Greek and Latin. Don’t impress your readers with undulating sentences.

Your content isn’t about you and your business.

Your content is about your readers.

Connect with his wishes, dreams, and secret desires.

Be engaging. Be enchanting. Be good.
