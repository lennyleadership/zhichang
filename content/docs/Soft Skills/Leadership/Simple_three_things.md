title: "Focus On Three Simple Things"

John Maxwell said, "People don't care how much you know--until they know how much you care."  

You establish authority not by spouting information and facts with a booming, powerful voice. You do it by cultivating relationships. You do it by letting people know that you sincerely care about their welfare.  

Now here are three things that every leader should be the most concerned about.   

## People 

Businesses are great things. But they are nothing without people. Even if you are an Internet Entrepreneur, and everything you do is automated, you need people to buy your stuff to keep it going.  

The biggest capital you have isn't the number of dollars you have in the bank. It's the people who make your vision a reality.  

So let them know you care about how they're doing.  

When someone is excited about something, be supportive. Ask her to tell you more about it. Listen intently and suspend any judgments that come to mind.     

She'll love you for it.  

When someone is sad, come alongside and grieve with her. Maybe she just lost a loved one unexpectedly. She could be in an accident on the way to or from work. Her spouse could decide to run off with her best friend.  

Be there when it hurts and you'll form a relationship with cords that are hard to break. 


## The Good of the Organization 

As a leader, you're responsible to see that things go well for everyone. In other words, you want to maintain an environment where people are free to do their best in whatever role they're in.     

This might create conflict.
