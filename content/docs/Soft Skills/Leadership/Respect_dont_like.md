If you're honest, at some point you'll have a coworker you just can't stand.

But since you have to work together, you smile and pretend it doesn't bother you at all.   


**Your Smile is Lying**  

Here's the problem.

Did you know that your true feelings always show in your voice?   
No matter how you try to fake it, if you're angry it will leak out. If you're nervous, your voice will reveal even the slightest quiver and hesitation. And if you're disinterested, it will take away from the melody you normally have when you're feeling great.   

So what's the solution?   

Acting classes?   

No.   

Should you just fire the person due to irreconcilable differences?   

That might be admissible in court if you're getting a divorce, but not in the workplace.


**The Power of Forgetting**

Sometimes it's really good to forget.   

The best thing you can do when you have to work with someone who annoys the snot out of you is to forget that you can't stand them.   

I'll bet you're standing there thinking, “Yeah, like I can do that.”   

If you can't, then you're dead in the water.


Three Reasons Why You Should Forget You Can't Stand That Annoying Coworker Here are some things to remember when dealing with someone who makes your life difficult.

**1. As people, they have value**.  

If you believe life is precious, you have to agree that people—all people—have value.   

Now what about vicious criminals whose sole purpose in life is to maim and kill? Don't they deserve to die?   

Sure.  

But let's think about this. When someone's behavior is reprehensible to the point of killing others, death is a reasonable punishment. But you'll notice that in our court system, that is **the last resort**. Why? Because we as a society value life. We want to **believe in second chances**. We want to give others every opportunity to make things right.    

And, if you were to be convicted of a murder you didn't commit, would you want to be quickly condemned to death? 

Sure, she may have some annoying habits like filing her nails during meetings. Maybe she's loud enough to hear across the building when she talks. But if she has a brain, she has the potential for good ideas. If she has friends, then she must be doing something right.
