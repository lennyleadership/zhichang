MB Hydro: Teamwork

<!--more-->

DEFINITION

Teamwork is about working cooperatively and collaboratively with diverse individuals, teams, work groups and across organizational boundaries to achieve team and organizational goals. It includes demonstrating respect for individual differences (e.g. race, gender, ethnicity, disability, language, sexual orientation, age and opinions), valuing the opinion of others and insisting on a respectful workplace.


WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

Manitoba Hydro works across departments, organizations and cultures. Employees must work co‐operatively sharing best practices, breaking down departmental and other barriers, and communicating fully on new initiatives and priorities.  The ability to build an inter‐cultural understanding to create dynamic partnerships ensures that Manitoba Hydro understands and meets the needs of its employees, customers and strategic stakeholders.
