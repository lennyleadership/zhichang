The skill levels are structured to show the increasing sophistication or complexity at which the competency can be demonstrated. The levels of initiative, planning, problem‚Äêsolving and impact increase as the levels increase.

Level 1  

Describe more reactive behaviours.  
Level of thinking required is more situational (how to do the task or deal with the situation).  
Not a high level of planning involved.   
Impact is that the task is accomplished (e.g. giving a customer a refund).  


Level 2  

Describes behaviours that require <mark class = "lemon">being actively engaged</mark>.  
Not just dealing with the task but trying to resolve an overall situation or issue (e.g. helping a customer find an item, probing and meeting customer needs). 
Involves a level of initiative to address a situation satisfactorily.  
Impact is on the job or role.  

Level 3

Describes behaviours capable of resolving the critical factors behind the situation.
Behaviours at this level are more proactive and often focussed at addressing the root cause of things - looking at patterns. (e.g. noticing a pattern with tools from certain supplier, resolving problems with supplier or changing supplier.)  
Impact at section or department level. 

Level 4

Often the intent is to initiate change.  
Catalytic in terms of degree of initiative.
