We've just seen how not being very clear about what you want to say creates fuzziness in your writing.

I want to see, now, that clarity also suffers when causal links in a sentence don't line up properly.

Now this is a really subtle point, but I want to give it to you anyway, because it helps to make your writing really exceptional.

Let me show you what I mean by causal elements in a sentence.

Here's a sentence about Australia, a country that exports a lot of raw materials like coal, copper and iron ore.

I want you to really try hard to understand what it means completely, this sentence.

And don't worry if you don't have any knowledge of the subject, because that doesn't matter here.

We're just looking at the sentence as a piece of writing, and it's really helpful to do that with stuff that you aren't that familiar with.

Now, here's the sentence: 
>*<b>"Plunging coal exports forced a sharp drop in government revenue this year, economists say."</b>*

Did you get it? Or do you experience, as I do, a bit of a mental blank when you're reading it, as if something's kind of missing from it?

<u>Do you find you had to read it again</u> in order to really get it?

<u>Do you find that you have to supply some kind of information of your own</u> to truly get it?

Well, that's because something actually is missing.

Take a close look.

Basically, it's meant to be a causal statement, right?

It's saying that plunging exports caused a steep drop in government revenue this year.

The sentence is trying to draw a link, basically, between two happenings, between falling exports of coal etc.. on one hand, and lower government revenue on the other.

Now, there is definitely a causal link between those things, as most economists will know.

Falling exports do often cause government revenue to fall.

But why? why did they do that?

Why are those two things linked? in this sentence that we have.

That's not really spelled out.

The link is not spelled out.

The problem is that the two things are quite far apart.

They are linked but they're far apart.

Exports don't just fall and then lead to lower government income.

The causal link between those two things in this sentence isn't spelled out clearly.

In other words, there is what I call a missing link in the sentence.

The two ideas correlated are just a bit too far apart to create immediate understanding of the meaning of the sentence.

That means the reader has to supply the connection themselves, if they know it.

If they don't know it, then they're really in trouble because they'll just <u>draw a blank</u>.

Now, we can make this sentence easier even for seasoned economists to understand, if we choose to make that causal link between those two things that we've highlighted explicit. And I want you to watch how doing this actually overcomes the abstract nature of the original sentence.

But first we've got to know what the missing link is, right?

And in this case, it's the link between falling exports and lower government revenue.

The link is this: lower tax receipts for the government from exporters due to their shrinking exports.

That's the kind of way it links together.

Now, if you can provide this missing information within the sentence itself, you're going to actually get a lot more clarity out of it.

So, let's look at this causal link again: 

>*falling exports*  
>*leading to ...*  
>*less tax paid by exporters to the government*  
>*leading to*   
>*lower government revenue.*

That's the exact causal chain of events. right?  

Now I want you to pause this now and have a go at writing this causal link into the sentence in a way that enables readers to get its meaning instantly.

Okay?

Now there are various ways to make this link explicit. Here's one way: 
>*"Plunging coal exports forced a sharp drop in government revenue this year, economists say, as producers of the fuel paid less tax."*

Now, what we've done is put the ideas together in a way that's more logically connected, or fully connected.

Now, we could go a step further in establishing a causal link and I want to show you how to do this too.

You could consider that the sentence might become even more clear if you connected another two dots.

For instance if you ask, why do falling exports cause lower tax payments?

The answer is because coal companies earn less when exports drop, which leaves them with less money to pay in tax.

So now, the causal picture would look like this:

>Falling exports  
>leading to ..  
>lower earnings for those companies,   
>leading to   
>less tax  
>leading to   
>lower government revenue. 

Now, you do have to decide, you know, the right levels of causal detail to go into because you can't you can overdo this and end up with massive unwieldy sentences that state a lot of what might be obvious.

So, it depends on the reader, and you do have to draw a line somewhere with causal links in the chain.

But I just want you to be aware of how you can turn abstract sentences with missing links into clearer ideas step by step.

So, how might you write that new causal link, you know, lower earnings of those companies, into the sentence? Have a go and then come back.

Okay, here's what I might do:

>*"Plunging coal exports meant producers earned less and thus contributed less tax triggering a sharp drop in government revenue this year, economists say."*

Now, I want you to just compare that with the original version, where there is a large gap between the two parts of the sentence; where the causal link is very far apart.

>*"Plunging coal exports forced a sharp drop in government revenue this year, economists say."*

Now, notice how much easier we've made it for readers to understand the sentence quickly by supplying more links in the causal chain.

The real lesson here is that you've got to write in a way that doesn't leave the reader's mind going blank, or in a way that forces them to make inferences.

What you're saying should, as much as possible, spell out the logical connection between ideas, without of course making the sentence too long and unwieldy, or stating what might be too obvious to be worth stating.

Now, there's an easy way of telling whether you've left out key logical connections as in the original sentence, because simply when you read what you've written back, if you find that your mind goes blank while reading it, it usually means the logical connection is too far apart, and that there is at least one missing link in your sentence.

If you're not feeling it, as if it's kind of an instantly gettable point, it's telling you that something is probably wrong, which means you have to go back and fill out the picture for readers a bit more. A lot of writers will just let this go and hope that readers will somehow make the necessary inferences.  But remember, this is your responsibility, to make sure all your ideas are clear and that everything lines up nicely.
