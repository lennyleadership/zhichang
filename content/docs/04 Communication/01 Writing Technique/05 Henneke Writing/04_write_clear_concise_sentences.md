**Clear and concise** sentences are sculpted rather than just written. But how?

## How to write clearly and concisely

What if writing was like sculpting?

Imagine a huge piece of marble in front of you.

And in your hand, a chisel.

How would you sculpt a beautiful nude?

First, you conjure up an image in your mind: a vision of her beauty. Is she sitting or standing? Or dancing? What impression should she make?

Is she voluptuous or lean? Does she have small feet? Large hands? A big nose?

When you set to work, you consider the right proportions first—the length of her legs, arms, torso, neck and head. Then you work on the details—her delicate curves, her nose, eyes, and her hair.

Sculpting your sentences is like making the light dance around the curves of your beautiful nude.

## How to sculpt concise sentences

To sculpt your sentences, you eliminate excess words to create an enjoyable rhythm and a pleasurable reader experience. You allow your readers to dance through your content, feeling light and airy. You communicate your message with more clarity and strength.

Sound good?

To practice your sculpting skills, don’t work on a long piece of text. Instead, work on a headline, an opening, or closing paragraph. Consider writing each sentence on a new line, so focusing your attention on each sentence becomes easier.

**This is the process for sculpting concise sentences:**

1. Read your sentence slowly
2. Highlight the most meaningful words
3. Rewrite your sentence by focusing on the meaningful words

Shall I show you some examples?

## 3 examples of clear and concise sentences

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
  
**Example sentence #1:**

When I started my own business, it has given me a whole new perspective to see the bigger picture when it comes to finding a work / life balance.

*Meaningful words in bold:*

When I **started** my own **business**, it has given me a whole **new perspective** to see the **bigger picture** when it comes to finding a **work / life balance**.

*Clear and concise version:*

Starting my own business has given me a new perspective on work / life balance.
  </blockquote>
</figure>


Note:  
 Many words have some meaning, but aren’t particularly strong. So don’t fret too long whether a word is meaningful or not. Go with your gut feeling; it’s not an exact science.

Also, in the example above, “the bigger picture” and “a new perspective” are similar phrases so I chose one and eliminated the other.


<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
  
**Example sentence #2:**

I will provide you with suggestions on your performance so you can overcome the challenges you encounter every day while working for a difficult boss, so you can feel less stressed.

*Meaningful words in bold:*

I will provide you with **suggestions** on your performance so you can **overcome** the **challenges** you encounter **every day** while **working** for a **difficult boss**, so you can feel **less stressed**.

*Clear and concise version:*

I help you overcome the daily challenges of working for a difficult boss, so you feel less stressed.
  </blockquote>

Note:
 Verbs like “provide,” “add,” and “make” may seem meaningful, but they’re relatively weak. Often, you can “merge” them with a noun to create a stronger verb. For instance:

- To provide comments—to comment
- To add a splash of color—to splash colors
- To make progress—to progress

The nouns “comments,” “splash,” and “progress” are called “zombie nouns.” These nouns may sound impressive but they suck the lifeblood out of your verbs.

  <blockquote>
  
<b>Example sentence #3</b>:

*Meaningful words in bold:*

*Clear and concise version:*

Focusing on meaningful words helps you understand what your sentence should communicate, so your content becomes more concise and your message becomes clearer.

But writing concisely may take more time and effort than you’d think. At times, you may pull out your hair wondering how to make a sentence shorter. That’s normal. Don’t despair.

Sculpting your sentences takes practice. Approach it as game (not an exam!), work through different variations, and give yourself a time limit, so you don’t keep fussing for hours.

The more you practice, the faster you tighten your sentences.

## Writing clearly and concisely is a craft

> Tools not rules: We could think of writing as carpentry, learning how to use a set of tools. Rules were all about what is right and what is wrong. Tools are all about cause and effect, what we build for the audience.
> 

Tightening sentences is one of many tools in your writer’s toolbox. And no strict rules exists about how much you should tighten your sentences.

You’re the writer. It’s your voice. So write like you want to write. Be careful you don’t chisel away the fascinating details and suck the life and energy out of your content. Read your copy aloud. How does it sound? What’s the rhythm? Is reading your text tiring or invigorating you?

Writing as tight as possible is not your aim.

Your ultimate aim is to communicate your message with clarity so you can connect with and inspire your audience.
