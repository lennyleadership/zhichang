Laughter is said to be the best medicine. Here are some great jokes to help you laugh and make your day brighter.

1: Pool Donation:  
The other day some girls knocked on my door and asked me for a small donation for a local pool.  
I gave them a bottle of water.  

2: What is Beauty?  
A son questioned his father, "Dad, what is beauty?"  
Have you ever looked at your mother?, replied dad.  
Yes, the boy said innocently.  
Dad: Well, that’s just what it isn't!  

3:Barbie Doll:  
A dad is about to buy a toy for his daughter and asks the salesperson, "How much does the Barbie in the window cost?"  
The toy store worker responded condescendingly: But which one?  
We now have:  
Barbie goes to the gym, which costs 19.95 euros.  
Barbie plays volleyball for 19.95 euros.  
Barbie goes shopping for 19.95 euros.  
Barbie goes to work for 19.95 euros.  
Barbie is going to dance for 19.95 euros,  
and a divorced Barbie for €265.95  

The man, confused, inquired:  
Why is the Divorced Barbie 265.95 euros, while the others are 19.95?  
The saleswoman with an air of self-sufficiency replied: Sir, divorced Barbie comes with Ken's Car, Ken's house, Ken's boat, Ken's furniture, Ken's computer... As well as Ken's friend!  

4: Court Hearing:  
"Did you feel nothing when you chopped your wife to pieces and put her in the pot?" the judge inquired.  
Yes, I cried at one point, said the accused.  
Judge: Oh, yeah? When, exactly? Accused: when I chopped the onions after she died!  


5: Maternity Ward:  
The ecstatic father was snapping photographs of his newborn kid in the maternity ward. -Is this your first son, sir?- Inquires the nurse.  
Man: No, I already have five, my first camera!  

6: The Light:  
Dad, what is love?- The son asked his dad.  
The dad replied: It is the light of life, my dear son.  
And marriage?, the son questioned.  
The father took a deep breath and said: Well, my innocent son, it's the bill that comes later.  

7: A Decent Job:  
Hannah to Tommy: What is your job?  
Tommy: Basically to breathe. I don't earn much, but it gives me a living.  

8: Take The Money Man:  
How did the trial go, Manuel?  
The judge has said that 5 years in prison or 95 thousand euros.  
Don't be a fool; take the money!  


9: No Enemies:  
"How many of you have forgiven your enemies?" the priest questioned at the end of the Sunday service.  
Eighty percent of the people in the room raised their hands.  

The priest then asks, will you all forgive your enemies?  

Everyone answered this time, except for an old lady.  

Mrs. Joseph, Are you unwilling to forgive your enemies?  

I have no enemies, she sweetly replied.  

Mrs. Joseph, it is very unusual. What's your age?  

She replied: 99.  

The community stood to praise her.  

Could you please come forward and explain to us how you lived for 99 years without having enemies?  

Mrs. Joseph came to the front and addressed the assembly, saying:  

-Because all of those wretches have already died.  


10: The Huner Friend:  
Two friends go hunting in the woods. On the way, one of them collapses to the ground and remains motionless, his eyes open as if dead, with no sign of life.  
Then the other (who was not very smart) dials 911 from his cell phone and yells, "Help!" My friend seems to be dead; he is not moving!  
-Calm down, sir; first, you must ensure that he is truly dead.  
So the man throws down his phone, picks up his shotgun, points it at him, and fires.  
-Hello, yes, I'm sure he's dead now. So, what should I do now?

A farmer has a wife who loves to correct him.  
One day, he asks her if he can invite his friend Billy over for dinner. "Don't say Billy," she chastises, "say William."  

After they eat dinner, he asks William if he can tell him a tale. "Don't say tale," the wife says, "say anecdote."  

When the farmer is about to go to bed, he realizes that the kitchen light is still on. He asks his wife to put the light out, and she shakes her head. "Don't say put out," she corrects, "say extinguish."  

Later that night there is a strange noise coming from outside. The wife sends the farmer to go check it out. When he returns, she asks him what it was.  

"Well," he starts, "it was a William goat who I grabbed by its anecdote and extinguished!"
